### Introduction 

This README file provides the executive summary and findings on web scraping using reddit's API and the comparison of two classification models' (Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression) performance in identifying which subreddit a given post is from.

**Jupyter Notebook Organization**

Notebooks are arranged via following system: *1st digit . 2 digit . 3 digit*

- 1st digit: Project number

- 2nd digit: 

  - **Web scraping** (data collection) and **save to csv file** : **0** , 
  - **Rest of data science process** : **1**

- 3rd digit:  

  - **First** notebook: **1** 
- **Second** notebook : **2**, and so on.
  
  For example,
  
  - notebook 3.0.1 represents the first note book on Project 3, data collection
  - notebook 3.1.1 represents the first notebook on Project 3, data cleaning, EDA, modeling and evaluation

### Executive Summary
**<u>Context.</u>** The Google Business strategy team is trying to develop the strategic vision for its next-gen products. An important component of the Design thinking process is understanding the User's latent needs. Among the channels to solicit User needs, the team has also identified reddit as a potential information resource to harness insights on User needs. The Google Home products and the Google pixel are the two subreddits  that the team will be focusing on. The team would want to extract the reddit posts and classify them according to their sources (i.e. Google Home or Google pixel) before proceeding with further analyses.

**<u>Problem Statement.</u>** Manually trawling through the reddit posts to identify which post the subreddit came from is untenable, as the team has other project tasks on hand. Outsourcing this piece of work to other departments or interns is not favored due to potential of human error and sensitivity of the work. 

**<u>Proposed Solution.</u>** The team decided to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to help classify the extracted posts. The automation workflow would help alleviate workload thereby freeing up time for the team for high-value tasks. The model could also be re-purposed to classify other reddit posts, when the team moves to derive insights on User needs on competitors' products.

**<u>Findings.</u>**

**<u>Recommendations and Way Forward.</u>**
