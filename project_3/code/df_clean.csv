105,googlehome,"I've bought an LG WK7 for mothers day and I was trying it out today before I will give it. So the setup process was super easy and quick. She will be using it mainly for listening to radio, so I tried out the ""play radio station xyz"" command, and it started playing that station via TuneIn. So that's great, works fine and sounds fine. When I press the pause/play button on top it pauses the music. Pressing it again resumes the music.

However, after around 30 minutes of pausing the music, the resume no longer works. The button on top lights up, but nothing else happens. I tried waiting a few seconds, and pressing the button like crazy, but obviously no dice.

So what's wrong here? Is this a Google Home limitation? TuneIn limitation? A setting? A bug? I haven't tried any other services (are there any at all that it supports?).

112,googlehome,"Hi,

I have a Nest WiFi and a Home at two ends of a fairly large room, which has created the perfect opportunity to test their capabilities against one another directly. In theory, they should perform the same, recognize the same words, know the same things. That is not the case. The Home, in my unscientific study, is far superior. I am wondering why.

&amp;#x200B;

A few examples:

Nest WiFi tells me all the time I haven't selected a default music provider. I have. It's Spotify, and Home has no problem with it. I can literally walk to the other end of the room, say the same words, and have it work.

Nest WiFi doesn't know which TV I'm talking about. Home does, which is kind of ridiculous because in the Home app, WiFi is in the same room as the TV but Home isn't. Bizarre.

When I ask Nest WiFi for things, it can't find them on the internet, when Home does after getting the exact question. Happens with weather, random searches.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what I'm encountering is that Nest WiFi is a great little router appliance, does a good job as a speaker that I control from my phone with ChromeCast, but sucks sucks sucks as a smart device. It would seem to me that the software on board is the same, but it appears not.

121,googlehome,"I am not sure where to put this so please forgive me.

So I was out yesterday at my local target and of course they have free wifi which I use for the app and price match with amazon/review of product before I buy.  

Within a minute of getting on to their wifi, my phone notified me that I was playing music on my wifi.   At first I was thinking that I accidentally triggered music playback which is possible.  I opened up the google home app and noticed it play a song thru spotify casting to ""Den Speaker"".   I know I don't have any BT speakers with that name.   I thought my phone accidentally  connected to someone's speaker so I turned that off and turned off the music that was playing.   A few seconds later it started up again.  I turned it off again.  It went back on.

As I approached the electronics department I noticed two employee's just chilling as it seemed like it was a slow day.  I found out that one of the employees was playing music from a speaker under the counter.  I checked my phone and yep another spotify track was playing.   Out of curiosity I raised the volume on my phone and behold my phone was controlling the BT speaker!!!!   I went up to the employee and let him know that some how their BT speaker was giving people access to their music controls.  At first he didn't believe me but then I showed him the track he was currently playing on my phone and how I didn't have spotify on my phone.  He thanked me and turned off the music.   A few minutes later after I left the department his music was once again playing on my phone and I had access to music controls.

&amp;#x200B;

This has never happened before.   Is this a bug or a known issue ?   I don't recall the BT speaker or his phone as I was keeping my distance.

129,googlehome,"So here goes: I completely reset my WiFi router today, and my google homes all disconnected. When I tried to set them up again on my “new” WiFi network with the new password, my main google home said something went wrong and couldn’t be set up. As I’m sure you all know, for whatever reason, when google home devices are plugged in but not connected to internet they show an unsecured WiFi network called the name of the speaker followed by a period and a lowercase letter. (“Basement Speaker.o” for example.) But in addition to my two speakers that were showing up on my WiFi list, there was another new WiFi network called “Family Room TV.b” When I try to set up this device in the Google Home app, it says it’s a Chromecast. I don’t have any Chromecasts, but I figured it might be my Xbox One that was connected to my google assistant and was able to control my TV (on/off, and volume up/down) however, I don’t remember ever calling this Xbox or TV “Family Room TV”. 

Here’s the weird part: I unplugged my router, modem, Samsung smartThings hub, and the power surge that connects my TV, and all video game consoles including the Xbox One, to power. And the unsecured network “Living Room TV.b” is still there. I’m losing my mind at this point, thinking it must be one of my neighbors networks, that I just happened to notice after I reset my router, because how could it be mine if it still shows when all my devices are unplugged? The google home speakers don’t show up on WiFi when unplugged. So does anyone know if this is my network or someone else’s, and if it is mine, how I would get it to go away? Or should I even bother? Is this a potential security flaw? Could someone take this network over and use it to infiltrate my secured home network?

I thought I’d share my experiences from today, and see if anyone had a similar experience

Today I tried to get the weather from Google, but I noticed that my Home Mini is unresponsive. Upon restarting, all I got was four solid white LEDs. 

After some googling, I found that this was a common issue at the end of 2019 and the only solution was getting a replacement. 

So I got in touch with Google support and after a few strange rituals (unplug and plug back in 8 times; email a photo of the Home Mini next to the receipt and a piece of paper with the serial number), I was told they’d replace it. 

I was expecting them to tell me to bin the faulty one, but no, I was told I wouldn’t get a new one unless I printed off a return label and sent the current one back. In the middle of a pandemic. 

I emailed back to say libraries are closed and I can’t get to a printer until this is all over, so what now?

To vent my frustration, I tried a bit of percussive maintenance, and much to my surprise, the LEDs went out. Great, I broke it, I thought. But no! I saw the colourful lights, and heard the cheerful chime.

147,googlehome,"I have had an issue for over a year now where every podcast I play abruptly stops when I play it on my Google Home speakers. After starting it could be 5 to 15 minutes and the podcast will stop. My screens will show the podcast app, but not show which episode or progress. Sometimes I lose the progress in the app, sometimes the podcast totally restarts and I lose my place.

Initially to debug I have turned off power saving for Google Podcasts and Pocket Casts, I have unplugged every speaker except one, I have tried numerous differences on my router settings. I have tried turning off my phone and starting a podcast with my voice and it would still fail.

Here is the list of what worked and didn't for me. The only one that worked without any pauses or glitches was Podcast FM. Pocket Casts was my favorite but its failure to work on my Google Homes made me move away.

One of the nice uses of the Google Home Mini for myself -- as well as some senior citizens that I provide 'computer' assistance to -- is the ability to use interactive voice commands of Google Assistant to link to YouVersion Bible.  Voice instructions to read specific passages works just fine.  Voice instructions to read from a YouVersion bible plan also used to work perfectly -- but not anymore! Some sort of communication breakdown now occurs frequently, and the result is that a daily Bible plan reading is stopped prematurely: either not all passages are read -- or they are read OK but the daily reading is not ended properly, resulting in the next day repeating the same reading -- as if YouVersion did not mark the previous day as 'completed'.  The only thing that can be done in these circumstances is to manually 'mark' the passages as completed (on the YouVersion bible website) -- so that the next day can (hopefully) continue successfully.

I was so excited to tell it to launch Hulu. My TV immediately said ""Please use the remote to enter commands"" or something similar. Google barked at me that this device doesn't support that.

So I went into Google Home. Selected the Roku TV. Pressed power. Poof - it went off. Great.

Next logical step: can it then turn it back on? *Click*...

Darkness. No logo. No home screen. Darkness.

I could move around the menus and hear everything like normal, but absolutely no picture.

1. The hard reboot (unplugged 30 seconds.)
2. Unlinking Roku
3. Unplugging all inputs and internet and hard rebooting
4. Factory reset by remote combination
5. Factory reset by reset pin on the tv
6. Holding power for 20 seconds on remote

Note: when it's hard reset, it DOES show Roku on the screen for ONE FRAME clearly before it's back to darkness. It's like it's fine until it reads some setting and goes right back to black.

226,googlehome,"Edit: looking at the votes, it is incredible that this sub is full of people who just want to roll over and take the garbage state of things instead of at the very least trying to understand why google home is in such a sorry state when it comes to IR control.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, so I know I have a lot to learn when it comes to home automation.  I've generally had a plug and play experience with smart bulbs.

I've tried with several devices to enable google home to control my (mid-high end) home theater.  Denon has been full of promises of compatibility but only if you are using their proprietary music streaming service.  They are still promising new functionality ""to come"" on their 2019 year models.

So this is what I currently see as the state of google home and IR control:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/c7aiwg/using\_a\_generic\_wifi\_ir\_universal\_remote\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/c7aiwg/using_a_generic_wifi_ir_universal_remote_with/)

In 2013, the Xbox One, a game console, released with Kinect bundled in, and it was capable of the majority of the commands I need, such as volume control, OUT OF THE BOX.  In 2013!

Today, I can buy an IR blaster and set  up a remote.  But then google home only reads it as an On/Off switch.  The instructions in the link go into setting up a custom device with custom scenes for each function you want.  Also you have to use IFTTT.

It seems like it really shouldn't be too hard to link an IR command to a voice command, so what gives?   1) The app has buttons.  2) Expose the buttons to google home through the api.  3) Add the buttons to a routine or sequence.  It seems like the problem is in part 2).

My cynical side says that, since some products that might actually work (Logitech) sell for more than $100 dollars, no $20 device manufacturer wants to give out this functionality.

I suppose that IR commands are open-ended (no feedback), and the google home system might be built around complete loops in order to ensure stability.

In my home (shared with 3 other people each with their own apartment) there is one router and for everyone a different WiFi access point so everyone has their own SSID and settings.

But when he plays something on his chrome cast it doesn't play on one of my speakers.

298,googlehome,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Like everyone else I have had a lot of spare time recently and I have set up my Google Home so it can control my Sky Q box. Discalimer: It is messy, there is probably a cleaner way of doing it and none of it is my own work (followed various different guides and collated them all here)

&amp;#x200B;

**Requirements:**

Google Assistant (any) 

Sky Q box on latest software

Raspberry Pi with Raspbian installed 

IFTTT account (free)

TriggerCMD account (free)

**Directions:**

***Control your Sky box from the command line / terminal***

Open a terminal on a fresh install of Raspbian or SSH in to the pi from your computer. (Google this if you are unsure.

`npm install -g sky-remote-cli`

This will either install `sky-remote-cli` successfully or will let you know if it is missing anything. Google any errors you get and try the command again until it has installed fully. 

Check this is working by typing the following in to the terminal which should simulate pressing the home button (complete list of working commands / buttons is at the bottom of this guide.)

`sky-remote-cli 192.168.X.X home`

The  X's need to be replaced by the last digits of your Sky box (to find this on your sky box press home &gt; scroll to settings &gt; Network connection &gt; Network setup &gt; advanced settings)

Keep that terminal window open...

***Install TRIGGERcmd on Raspberry Pi***

Log in to your TRIGGERcmd account here [TriggerCMD](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/computer/create)

click instructions on the left - you will need your token (shown in red) in the next step

Back in the terminal window / SSH window to install TriggerCMD on the raspberry pi:

`sudo su -`  
`apt-get -y update`  
`apt-get -y upgrade`  
`apt-get -y install npm nodejs`  
`wget` [`https://s3.amazonaws.com/triggercmdagents/triggercmdagent_1.0.1_all.deb`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/triggercmdagents/triggercmdagent_1.0.1_all.deb)  
`dpkg -i triggercmdagent_1.0.1_all.deb`  
`triggercmdagent`  
`( Paste in your token, and press ENTER. )`  
`( Press CTRL-C to quit. )`  
`/usr/share/triggercmdagent/app/src/installdaemon.sh`

[If you need any help refer to their forums here for assistance](https://www.triggercmd.com/forum/topic/12/raspberry-pi-setup)

If this is all done successfully you should now see your raspberry pi under 'your computers' on TriggerCMD website.

***Add the Sky Q commands to TriggerCMD***

Back in the terminal window type

`systemctl stop triggercmdagent`

Then 

`nano /root/.TRIGGERcmdData/commands.json`

Each one of the lines in the curly brackets relates to a command the TriggerCMD can run i.e. the string of button presses we want to send to the sky box.

You can either write a whole new command or just type over the ones that are already there but they must follow exactly the same format:

`{""trigger"":""Reboot"",""command"":""shutdown -r"",""ground"":""background"",""voice"":""reboot"",""allowParams"": ""false""},`

You only really need to change 2 of the parameters. in the above example: 

""Reboot"" is the name of the command 

""shutdown -r"" is the command that gets sent

In my case I wanted a command that would put the football on sky so i changed it to:

`{""trigger"":""SkyFootball"",""command"":""sky-remote-cli 192.168.X.X home home home dismiss dismiss dismiss 4 0 1"",""ground"":""background"",""voice"":""reboot"",""allowParams"": ""false""},`

The command that needs to be sent is just the same as the test from step 1 including your Sky boxes IP address followed by the buttons you would press each separated by a space. I have changed mine to `home home home dismiss dismiss dismiss 4 0 1` (putting home 3 times and dismiss 3 times ensure that the box will turn itself on and be on a channel (and not a menu page) ready for the 4 0 1 input that puts on Sky Sports main event. Full list of buttons / commands is at the bottom of this guide.

It is really important that each of these lines is within curly brackets and finishes with a comma apart from the last line. 

when done hold ctrl and X to exit, then Y when prompted to save and enter to confirm where it will be saved.

This will put you back in to the terminal where you can type

`systemctl start triggercmdagent`

If everything has worked you should be able to go to 'Your Computers' section of TriggerCMD and click ""view triggers"" where you will see your command you just added. Test it out by pressing Trigger (you can do this once per minute so be patient if testing multiple times!)

If everything has been set up you should see your Sky box follow the commands you inputted (in my case open the home page (3 times), clear home page (3 times), and go to 401.) 

Add as many commands as you want and once you are as long as you are happy here 

***Set up Assistant to run these commands using IFTTT***

***I***n [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) click explore, then create.

Change the THIS to google assistant and ""say a simple phrase"" input the command you would like to give - in my case ""Put football on Sky"". You can also add a reply so you know it has been successful - I used ""enjoy the game!"" Press create trigger.

Change the THAT to triggerCMD and ""trigger a command"" you can now select your command from the drop down. Then create action. Finally Finish. 

IFTTT can take a few minutes to add new commands so go and make a brew and in a few minutes cross everything and try out your command - Hey google, Put football on Sky. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's it all done. With The free TriggerCMD account you can only run 1 command per minute - if you want more you can pay for it and support the developer (I  encourage this as his work made this all possible!)

The commands that can be sent are as follows:

`sky`  
`power`

`tvguide`  
`home`  
`boxoffice`  
`services`  
`search`  
`interactive`  
`sidebar`

`up`  
`down`  
`left`  
`right`  
`select`

`channelup`  
`channeldown`  
`i`

`backup`  
`dismiss`  
`text`  
`help`

`play`  
`pause`  
`rewind`  
`fastforward`  
`stop`  
`record`

`red`  
`green`  
`yellow`  
`blue`

`0`  
`1`  
`2`  
`3`  
`4`  
`5`  
`6`  
`7`  
`8`  
`9`

...and that's all there is to it. Drop any questions / issues below but please bear in mind all I did was mess around, follow other people's guides and collate them all here.

300,googlehome,"In the past I could ask Google to find my phone or ring my phone and it would ring my phone.

Now when I ask Google to ring my phone it says, ""if you want me to call your Android phone you can say find my phone, if you want to find your Android phone on a map..""

The problem is when I ask Google to find my phone the device lights up and flashes liked it does when completing a request, but then nothing else happens.  The device doesn't give any voice prompt saying ""I'm now ringing your phone at full volume"" or anything at all. It just flashes and then nothing.

I have made sure that my Google home app, the Google home mini, Google play, Google find device app, and the phone are all on the connected to the same account. All of the apps are functioning properly.  I can find device manually with the find my device app and can make my phone ring with the app.  

Any ideas would be helpful at this point.  If I really need to find my phone I can just tell the Google home mini to call my phone using duo.  It's just really frustrating that I haven't changed anything and now I have lost a function.  It just doesn't make sense.

312,googlehome,"I have been an Alexa user for three years now.  I have been considering switching to Google Home.

I have been looking into adding security cameras this year after my first home purchase. I’ve done some research on a few brands and really like how easy it is to view the camera feeds using Google Home/Nest VS Amazon Alexa/Ring (main reason for considering Google Home). 

I also like the look-n-feel of their products a little more. Especially the Google Home Hub.

I have also grown tired of Alexa screwing up my commands (for example, “Alexa turn on air conditioning” is always followed by her not understanding it). I’ve read that Google Home is smarter, is it better at voice recognition?

Please post any feed back you have, I am very interested in hearing what you have to say.

326,googlehome,"I bought four of the indoor floodlight bulbs at my local Walmart for my bedroom to go along with two of the regular light bulbs they offer that I already had. The install was easy and they are working well, zero issues with all six bulbs. 

I decided to get the same bulbs for my living room and kitchen(open concept). I ordered some off of amazon as they were $10 cheaper per 2 pack. Half of them came in yesterday and they were first gen. I figured as long as I updated the firmware they’d act the same way. I was able to install most of them without any issues and the others that have me some trouble eventually connected. There are 10 total, as of now and I have 8 more on the way.

I went to test them this morning and realized that the bedroom lights turn on together and smoothly. The living room lights seem to turn on in small groups(3 or so at a time) and in some cases they turn on individually. 

The big question. Are the living room lights turning on in this manner because there are more than 6 lights in one room(I read somewhere that it’s recommended to not have more than 6 group together) or is this because the bulbs are technically “old”, even though the firmware has been updated? 

My OCD is heightened because of the staggered on and off nature of the living room lights and I want things to work smoothly across the board.

When I use a workout app I have an iOS shortcut set to play through my 'iPhone speakers' at 100% volume (so I can hear the instructions over the music). However as I was casting music, it applied that volume to my Home Max. So it started blaring it at 100% (with audible distortion, it jumped from the 15-20% I usually have). 

Now since I'm very precious about this thing and I just got the speaker literally hours ago, I naturally wonder if I have damaged the speaker in anyway. I can't say I hear any distortion at the volumes I like to listen to (I don't want to go too high since I live in an apartment).

 The base vibrates the desk and I hear the highs clear. Does that mean I got away with it?  Does the home max have some kind of volume limiter to protect the speaker if something like this happens? 

\*I also want to warn you guys using iOS shortcuts: even if you choose 'set playback destination to iPhone' and then a volume, it will still apply that volume to a chromecast speaker (if the phone has say Spotify running in the background, and your Spotify account is casting to speaker).

340,googlehome,"Background: Affected smart device managed by Google Home is configured and connected to a secured wireless network.

Exploit condition: Device cannot communicate with online service, either because WAN internet link is down or server connection is blocked/disrupted.

Outcome: Device activates WiFi hotspot, broadcasts its own SSID as an open unsecured wireless access point and serves as a gateway to the connected secure wireless network. This allows anyone in the area to connect and access internal LAN devices and network services - file sharing, streaming, router interface, IoT controls - it literally becomes a backdoor into the private network.

This issue has been known for months and publicly discussed by users.

I've verified that my Lenovo Smart Clock is affected and others have reported Google Home and Nest branded devices are affected. But there seems to be some confusion between the condition where the WiFi beacon is activated when the device can't connect to its configured wireless network and this ""network gateway"" vulnerability when the device is connected to a network but can't access the internet.

460,googlehome,"Hi,

I'm setuped as bilingual. En-CA/Fr-CA.

Recently I'm beginning to have some problems. If I give a command in french, she will understand Fr, but translate words and write En.

Example: ""OK Google, met une minuterie de 40 minutes pour les soupes à l'oignon"". (Which means, set a 40 minutes timer for the onion soup)

It's a Hub Max, so I can see she understood french. She wrote french too in the ""listening bar"". She also answers in french. But, and here is the problem, she will translate ""Soupes à l'oignon"" to ""Onion soup"" when wording the timer.

I also have this problem while taking notes with Bing! (linked to assistant). The item is added to a french named list like I instructed too, but ""Salade variée"" was translated to ""Variety of salad"" in the end result.

Why is the assistant translating words before writing them? Everything is shown as french, even the interface. All except the end result which she understood in french in the first place.

1) Why?
2) How to fix?
3) Best way to let Google know? I'm reporting way too many bugs thru the feedback UI since years and about 5% get actually fixed.

468,googlehome,"This is going to be a strange one. I'm having a lot of problems getting our speaker group ""Upstairs Speakers"" under controller.

For the past week, I've been having a lot of problems with Groups, specifically with _Google devices_ properly seeing their groups and who is in what group. Their behavior would indicate there are multiple groups by the same name floating around (how?). For example:

- If I asked our Google Hub to play on ""Upstairs Speakers"" - it would _only_ play on the Hub, even though it's playing on the speaker group ""Upstairs Speakers.""
  - The Google Home app would _not_ show it playing
- If I manually casted to ""Upstairs Speakers"", it would play on Office and Mst. Bedroom, NOT on the Hub. 
  - The Google Home app _would_ show it playing on ""Upstairs Speakers."" And now Hub is out of sync.
  - I can then unplug Google Hub, and it would start-up in sync.
- If I try asking Google to play (again), I go through this whole cycle again.

(PS: There's a 4th device is that mix that never seems to get a cast - after bullet 2, I can unplug/plug it in to sync it up like the Hub)

\^\^ All 4 devices show themselves as within group ""Upstairs Speakers.""

I have tried: deleting the group, removing/adding devices to the existing group, renaming the group... I cannot get ""everybody"" back together again under a singular group for some reason.

Now here's the kicker - today:

1. For some odd reason, now only our Chromecast Audio thinks it's within ""Upstairs Speakers.""  
    * All our other devices are listed within ""Upstairs Speakers."", but only the Audio will play when I vocally ask Google to play.
2. I removed 2 (out of 4) devices from the ""Upstairs Speakers"" group, and suddenly, the group disappeared!
    * Google Home app just _does not see_ Upstairs Speakers anymore. NONE of our devices are showing as playing. None of our devices are showing within ""Upstairs Speakers.""
    * **BUT** (I run HomeAssistant) HomeAssistant still sees it! AND HA says our Chromecast Audio is currently playing within ""Upstairs Speakers.""
   * The Chromcast Audio isn't even showing playing in the Google Home app even though it's very clearly playing music ....

Any clue what's going on here? Where are the Speaker Group details stored? Why do I have, seemingly, rogue speaker group(s) by the same name (HA has routinely seen multiple speaker groups, suffixing them with `_#`)? Is there some way to wipe out speaker group info and just start from scratch?

**Edit** I just found this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleWiFi/comments/dpnau0/client_isolation_issue/

Where it mentions:

&gt; Last Last Update: It appears we were all correct. The issue was infact mDNS as confirmed by This email I recieved today November 26th.

Huh, I wonder if this is related? I did recently upgrade our network to Unifi DreamMachine (from an old Netgear + ZYXEL routers)


**Edit 2**: Our Audio device just dropped offline (for reasons unknown). When it returned, ""Upstairs Speakers"" is BACK showing only 2 devices, but _only_ casting to the Audio device. And _this time_ Google Home _does_ show ""Upstairs Speakers"" and Audio playing. But the group keeps disappearing and reappearing ... /boggle

**Edit 3**: After some time, ""Upstairs Speakers"" group disappeared again, Audio no longer showing it's playing even though it is clearly playing. HomeAssistant still see them, however.

I plan on adding a Google Home in my bedroom. However, my router is at the opposite end of the house and as a result my bedroom happens to be in a wifi deadspot.

Could I connect the bedroom Google Home to the wifi extender, too? With the bedroom Google Home connected to ""MyNetwork_EXT"", and all other Google devices in my home connected directly to ""MyNetwork"", would they still be able to communicate with eachother?

507,googlehome,"So I've got my Google Home device connected to the internet via Ethernet.  Yay!  I used a Chromecast plug to make the connection.  Before that I used a socket-screwdriver heated over a gas stove flame to burn a hole in my gHome's base, melting through the fabric and plastic honeycomb.

Happily, the gHome seems to have auto-disabled the WiFi (as I cannot see it on my phone nor on my Macbook's airport).   But I cannot figure out how to control my gHome as I would via wifi (using the ""Home"" app on my phone).  

Is there a workaround to this?  I've tried looking for a plugin for the Chrome browser (no luck).  I've tried searching for an app for the Macbook OSX, no luck (but there seems to be software for PC's!).  I've even tried looking for the device in my local network using Mac's System Preferences and the [TPLink.app](https://TPLink.app) I use to control my Ethernet-over-Powerline network (no luck).

We are investigating this to analyse how useful and beneficial virtual assistants like Google Assistant are at work, and also to analyse the commonly reported problem of people with certain accents finding it harder for virtual assistants to interpret their commands.

Once we have collected enough data it will be forwarded to the R&amp;D divisions of all the relevant companies, like Google. So if you help us out you may actually have an impact on how virtual assistants are designed!

515,googlehome,"Hi all

We use our google home mini devices and chromecast audios to stream digital radio around the house. Unfortunately our internet is unstable, leading to losing connection 3-4 times per day on average. We lose our connection and it comes back after around 4 minutes. This isn't internal, nothing to do with my network - it is the line and out of our hands. There is a requirement to experience more than 6 dropouts in a day for it to be considered a fault by the network provider, and strangely it never seems to go above 5...

When this happens Google stops the stream, and then I have to ask it again to start the stream. This is annoying after the 2nd time, especially as I have to do it every day. We are working from home at the moment meaning that it is almost always on in the background.

528,googlehome,"Alright. Not sure if this is possible but here goes. Back story first I suppose.

 Growing up my dad had custody of my brother and I every other weekend and summers. We had limited time together but one of his favorite things to do was watch my brother and I play video games. He always had to newest console for us. We played a *lot* of racing games and every week, after we left for moms, he would work on our cars in the games. He kept notes of lap times and tire drop off and the tweaks he made for each track, for each car, for weather conditions, for tire class, for our driving styles... It was amazing. We even had a steering wheel set up in front of a bucket seat he got from the junk yard. He couldnt afford to let us race in real life but he got us as close as he could. If we weren't racing we were watching westerns. Dude tought his boys to read with the subtitles on Dances With Wolves.

As it goes my brother and I grew up. We both moved far away from home and keeping contact has been difficult. Last year my dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's. He's pretty far along. He lost his job and has pretty much been sitting in the same spot on the same couch in a basement bedroom for the past year. We get him out and about whenever we get back home but that's not nearly often enough. Last night I was laying in bed thinking back on those times with pops watching westerns laid out across his lap or having an explosive celebration after finishing a 24 hour race. That's when I got the idea.

Earlier this year my brother got pop a hub max and we've been using it to make duo calls. Is there a way for me to stream gameplay to my dads hub from my laptop?

I'm using playstation remote play to get the content to the laptop I just need a way to get it to my dad. I know it would mean the world to him to he able to watch his boys play vidya again.

537,googlehome,"\[SOLVED\] - had to set the phone/tablet to 2.4GHz band of home wifi instead of the 5GHz band prior to using Google Home to configure it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the larger version of Insignia's Google Assistant Speaker.  I did a reset to it recently (power cycle by long pressing the mute/power button in the back), and now it's in setup mode.  I've been unable to use Google Home app to set it up.  I've tried it on several phone, updated the google home app, but still no success.  The Home app seems to try to do the setup; I see the phone disconnect from regular wifi and connect to the Insignia speaker's wifi AP, but it sits there for long minutes not doing anything.  I've also tried using the reset button in the pin hold under the speaker.  No change.

I know Insignia stop supporting its smart devices that use the Insignia app, but since this is a google assistant device, I thought I'd be OK.  Not the case?  Anyone else have trouble with setting up there speaker?

At this point, I can't even use it as a clock.

I was having problems with my Google Home set up,  so I deleted both of the devices and 2 CC Audio I still have connected and deleted the saved Home profile and started over.

then

    ok google what do you remember?

and it will list them all back to you.

It also remembers your list across all your devices.

If you ask it on a Google Nest Hub then it has a list display, and suggests saying ""forget the 1st one"". It seems that it remembers all of the notes in this visual mode, but when listing it by voice it just says the recent ones.

It also has some kind of intelligence to it so you can say:

    ok google what colour is the car? 

It's a handy little note taking feature that I haven't see in any of the docs or tips videos that I've watched.

It's a subtle difference between ""ok google remind me..."" because you have to set a specific time for that, whereas ""ok google remember..."" is just an on-demand service, great for while you're busy doing some task or if you forget why you walk into rooms regularly... :)

I've tried tinkering around a bit with a Google Nest Hub and dug around a little bit here on /r/googlehome with no luck but wanted to ask: Can I use the Google Home (or other) app on my phone to queue up and play a specific YouTube video on a Google Nest Hub that's not on the same internet/WiFi?

Backstory: My grandma lives in assisted living and with COVID-19, they've been on lockdown for a seven weeks now. She doesn't have a smart-phone and doesn't get to see new photos or videos of her great-grandson, so I bought a Nest Hub and am going to ship it to her. I originally bought it just for the ambient Google Photos slide show and that alone is going to be ***fantastic***, but I wanted to see what else it can do from afar. 

She's not going to know how to use Google Assistant to look up things on her own so I was hoping there was a way I could select a YouTube video and cast it or queue it up on her display, half a state away on different WiFi. I tried just dropping video files in the Google Photos folder that the ambient display was linked to but that didn't seem to work. 

I have her Nest Hub set up on my personal Google Home/Google account and have seen I can Duo Video call the Display so that's also very nice.

738,googlehome,"Hi guys and gals,

To enable my grandmother to communicate better with my family in lockdown (I'm really worried about her mental state), I want to buy her a Google nest hub max for her birthday later this month, so she can receive video calls with the rest of us and get us into her home, figuratively.

Need your advice though.

My plan will be to buy the device and do as much set-up as possible in my own place, as my Grandma will be 90 and its not remotely possible for me to walk her through it, and then travel to hers, connect it to her router, from outside her apartment, and leave it outside, sanitised, so she can bring it in and just turn it on and go.

I have determined I can get within 5 metres of her front door, enough to pick up her internet signal, and connect to an extended power lead, so as to avoid me going anywhere near here or inside. I plan to be entirely suited up in protective gear (gloves, goggles, mask, apron) as well as sanitising anything I touch including the device. I'll be actually in the stairwell of her building, where she never goes, as well as spraying me feet and wearing minimal woolly clothing. I can do it safely 

However, I've never used a best hub max before. How much can I do before I get to her place? Does she need an email address registered specifically to the device? Can I set it up on my WiFi and she just connect to hers and bingo it's ready? If I set it up outside her door, and unplug it (so it is off, when she moves it back in), if she plugs it back in, will it just turn on and be ready to go immediately?  No sign in needed, just plug and play (I can call her immediately)? If she wants to turn it in and off at night, will it ever need her to do anything other than click ""answer"" when we call?

Really appreciate your help.

When you have a family attached to the device, each person should have their own colour, configurable (maybe only configurable by the head of the family or by the adults). That way, notifications immediately tell you by colour who in the family the notification is for - no need to ask.

Also, timers should pulse on the device - slow pulse for more than 5 minutes, medium pulse for more than 1 minute, fast pulse for less than a minute left. If multiple timers are going, it should show the next timer to time out (or maybe it can use all the lights to show multiple timers).

She does not have a phone, because she's 9, and I'm super against that.  She does however have a Chromebook and an iPad that was handed down to her from her grandmother.

Except there isn't anything to manage.  None of the features of the family link app work if you don't have an Android phone apparently.  Her chromebook is completely useless as a result, it will not allow her to install Google Play Movies or Music or basically anything else.  So we end up with my account logged into it, which is annoying.

Then there's Google Play Music.  She enjoys going to sleep listening to an album she loves, and we both cannot have music playing when this happens! ""Sorry you're GPM account is already in use.""  BUT we cannot add her google account to the Google Home app because she's under 13 I guess.

770,googlehome,"**Modem/Router**: Bell Home Hub 3000 (roommate’s devices are on here)

**My router** (connected to Home Hub via ethernet): ASUS RT-AX92U

Hi there,

Hope all is well. Have a bit of a strange scenario. I share my condo with a roommate and previously we were sharing the same wireless router/modem. Since there are several google home (chromecast) devices, I wanted to prevent any embarrassing mishaps and also just maintain some wireless security/privacy b/w myself and my roommate. So I bought my own wireless router (connected to the modem/router via ethernet) to set up my own connection as a partition. I assumed that my google home would NOT have visibility to my roommate’s device and his google home wouldn’t have visibility to mine.

I double-checked my wireless router to make sure the only devices connected to it are mine. Google Chrome on my laptop and desktop can’t don’t have visibility to or cast to my roommate’s device (TV).

**Problem:**

The issue is my phone (Google Pixel 2XL) can still see my roommate’s TV via Google Home despite the fact that the TV is on a different wifi network (connected to the modem/router) than the phone or other devices. I made sure to forget all other networks so it wouldn’t be able to connect to the other router.

But I also find that my phone can connect to  devices on the Home Hub 3000 even when connected to the AX92U. For example, my Nanoleaf Lights are connected to the Home Hub 3000 but I can connect to them via the AX92U.

**RESOLVED:** The 5Ghz backhaul connection seemed to provide connection back to the primary router.

794,googlehome,"With the ongoing crisis, many vulnerable and elderly people are confined at home or in a nursing home. Given how many posts I've seen asking for advice, I thought I would share my experience in setting up a Google Nest Hub Max during quarantine to communicate with an elderly relative confined within a nursing home.

**Background:**

My relative is 92 years old with early dementia, does not have a smartphone, has very little experience of using technology, and is confined in her room in a nursing home. The home has been closed off to visitors since the quarantine began.

**Why a nest hub max?**

I chose google's product because I found the interface to be more elderly friendly and discreet for people not used to digital devices in their room. The ambient display performs really well and the tablet just looks like a photoframe when not in use, and dims when you switch off the lights.

**What is it used for?**

* Video calls/messages and ""drop in"" using the routine feature (more on that below)
* Displaying family photos on the hub background using a Google Photos album which you can manage remotely.
* Remote controlling the device to play music for her, live TV, replays and YouTube content

**What you need:**

* Google Home Nest Hub Max
* Smartphone (preferably a spare to avoid mixing google accounts)
* 4g Router (optional see below)
* Travel Router (optional see below)

**Unpacking and initial set-up:**

After having the Hub Max delivered to my home address, I set it up on home Wifi (to begin with) using a spare Android Phone paired with a Google Account I created for my relative. This Android Phone does not have a sim card and will effectively serve as my relative's ""stand-in"" smartphone for the set up and other functions. I keep this one with me to remote control the Hub Max.

Using the Google Home App on the Android Phone I created a new home (""Eldery Relative's Home"") and:

* Linked my newly created relative's Google Duo account (no phone number yet see below)
* Linked my relative's Spotify Account and set Spotify as the preferred music player
* Set the background to display a shared family Google Photos album
* Set up the Nest Cam if required (please be mindful of privacy issues here)
* Invited myself using my day-to-day Google Account to ""Elderly Relative's Home""
* Installed TuneIn for radio and some live TV apps on the Android Phone

You'll want to make sure you test out and get familiar with all the commands, functionalities etc. before moving ahead.

**Nursing home drop-off and set-up: 3 scenarios**

Before you go any further: please note that in order to change the Wifi on a Hub Max you **must** first ""forget"" the existing network while connected to it. Unplugging it and moving to a new location without doing so will result in your Hub Max seeking the previous network.

1. Wifi without a Captive Portal: Make sure you complete the step above and head to the nursing home. Plug in the Nest Hub Max and using the Android Phone connect the Hub Max to the nursing home wifi. Once this is complete, hand over the Hub Max to staff and they can just plug it in the room as long as the SSID and encryption are the same. Please bear in mind this will be a public network (with potential privacy issues) and network policies which might interfere with the Hub Max. Note you can turn off the setting that allows others to cast to your device in ""Device Settings &gt; Let others control your cast media"".
2. Nursing Home Wifi with Captive Portal and Travel Router: In my case the nursing home had a captive portal network (similar to hotels and airports) which prompts a log in page the first time you connect. The Nest Hub Max can't handle these so to get around it you'll need to get a travel router (GL.iNet GL-MT300N) and have it bridge the nursing home wifi. Make sure to complete the captive portal log in using a device with a browser the first time you ""bridge"". This has a number of advantages in that the Nest Hub will be connected to a private network emitted by the Travel Router which you can set up beforehand. Note some captive networks periodically ask you to log in again in which case you'd have to connect to the travel router again...
3. Independent 4G network: If using the nursing home wifi ends up being too complicated or uncertain, you can decide to use a 4G router or plug-in a 4G key into a Travel Router, provided reception is adequate of course. This is the easiest, albeit more expensive, option during quarantine. You could even send both devices in the post once you've set up the Hub to connect to the router's network.

I ended going with the 4G modem as the nursing home is in a city with very good 4G coverage. I just dropped off a bag with a 4g router and the Hub Max. The staff plugged in both devices and voila! Video call with my relative after several weeks of confinement. Once quarantine is over I'll head over there to set up a travel router to bridge the wifi.

**Google Duo:**

The set-up is fairly simple apart from needing a mobile number so other users can find you. This proved a problem for my relative as she was unable to read the text message with the confirmation code which expires in 60 seconds. 

It turns out you can call Duo users who have registered their phone number using an email-only account in a browser window. Before we were able to get someone to give us the text code from her flip phone, I added friends and family to my relative's google contacts. I then called them by typing their number in Duo in  a browser from my home PC to allow them to ""find"" my relative's account. They could use the recent activity to call my relative on the Hub Max in the nursing home.

Note that group calls are not available on the Hub Max (yet).

**Mirroring Drop In feature:**

The Drop In feature allows users to connect to an Echo device without the other person needing to answer. This has obvious privacy issues but can come in handy when your relative has trouble answering calls or using the device (arthritis or bed ridden for example).

You can mirror this function on a Nest Hub Max with Duo by using a routine that calls a particular contact. In this case I set up a routine through the Google Home app on the spare Android Phone with my relative's Google Account with ""Call &lt;Contact's Name&gt;"" in the assistant action. I can then remotely activate the routine (wifi or cellular) using the Google Home App to start a call from my relative's Hub Max. Please be mindful and broadcast to let them know beforehand.

**Controlling the Hub Max remotely:**

Honestly one of the coolest things about this set-up is being able to remote control my relative's Hub Max from the spare Android Phone or my own phone (wifi and cellular) to play music, Spotify playlists or just live TV. I'll call her beforehand and asks what she wants to see/listen to.

To do this you can simply type a command into Google Assistant using an account from that Home. For example: ""Play &lt;Song&gt; by &lt;Artist&gt; on &lt;Hub Name&gt;"".

I thought she would be keen to try out some of the voice commands but this proved really difficult for her, despite having written them on labels around the Hub. The concept of talking to the tablet seems difficult to grasp, and is made worse by having to say ""OK Google"" before anything.

**Additional comments and tips:**

\-Arthritis and nails can make it hard to use a touch screen. I ended making my relative a homemade stylus using a long paint brush, a rubber tip from a pen and some thin wire. Plenty of tutorials online.

\-If you use a Google Photos album as a background on the Hub, you can insert a few slides with some instructions on how to use the tablet (i.e. how to listen to music). It's quite handy as they don't get lost like paper notes and you can swipe through them.

\-The cardboard form work that the Hub Max comes in makes for a great support for labels and instructions. I just cut out some areas at the back (for heat, sound and cable) and have the Hub sitting in it with labels around it (e.g. to call someone ""OK Google call..."")

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I think Smart Displays have the potential to be incredibly useful devices for the elderly, whether to stay in touch, access music or video content, set reminders or answer general questions. I can imagine they will become regular fixtures in retirement homes.

That's all I can think of for now but I'll be sure to add things to this guide. Please let me know if you've had other issues or things you would like to see added.

I just wanted to see if I've set it up wrong, or if it's a common problem. I'll give my Home a command that my phone Assistant never has a problem with and Home just about nearly has an aneurysm.

'I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Try updating your contacts on your phone,' or some variation of those words. This is after it says 'did you mean (these other 5 people with the same last name?' and after saying the name quite clearly each time it asks, eventually giving up.

I recently added my wife to my Google Home. Now the shopping list is parted between her and my voice and account.

I.e. before when only my account was linked to the Google Home, whoever put something on the shopping list via Google Home, it was put on my shopping list, which my wife could open on her phone.

  


Now when she puts something on the list, it's only shown on her shopping list in her account, when I do, it's put on my personal shopping list.

All we want is one shopping list on which either of us can put things on.

Sharing function does not work for some reason and doesn't solve the problem.  


Does someone has a solution for me?

With that being said one of the most disappointing things for me on this phone is the ability to restart, power off and toggle the quick settings (wifi, data, Bluetooth, etc) while the phone is locked. Coming from a phone where those things aren't possible until the phone is unlocked it seems very odd that this is the case from Google. 

With the find my device app being my only tool if my phone is lost or stolen, it's a little worrisome to know that an unauthorized user can easily take that tool away. Even if I remove the quick settings that would allow someone to do this (very inconvenient for the user), they can still turn the phone off just as easily. 

I understand why people wouldn't want this, but just like with people who prefer not to have a lock at all, there should be an option. Don't want to unlock your phone to turn on wifi? Cool!

835,GooglePixel,"Good Morning 

This morning I attempted to unlock my Google Pixel 4XL, but something strange was going on. The ""Talk Back"" feature was going off, constantly reading what was on the home screen after each time I touched the phone. I could not get my phone to swipe up. It just keeps reading. So I double tap on a notification and it gives me my pin code option. I have to tap a number 4 times just get it to recognize the number. Once I get into my phone ""Talk Back"" starts reading EVERYTHING. I can't swipe any direction or open any apps. Not even the one I clicked on the notification for. Weird. So I restart the phone hoping that maybe it's just bugging out. This turns out to be a terrible idea because now my phone is set to Do Not Disturb. So I no longer have the only way I was able to get into my phone. I can't use the google assistant either. My phone is completely unresponsive except for the ""Talk Back"" feature.

What do I do? I've tried literally everything I can think of and nothing is working. Has anything like this happened to anyone? Fourms about Pixel issues are sparse so my only option is hoping that the Verizon store is opened today. I just had to break my plan to get this phone after my Pixle 2's digitizer went out.

is pixel 4a gonna be better in these ways:

from most important to least

**price:** &lt;$280

1. **comparable or better display than galaxy a51**: what are the main sites that tests the display quality of phones (brightness, color, everything else about displays, etc.)? so we can compare. has to, at the bare minimal, have similar resolution + screen size, or better
2. **better or comparable gps antenna than galaxy a51:** how does the gps antenna compare to other ones? any tests / analysis? what company made the gps antenna?
3. **phone options:** what newer or old phones have comparable resolution and dispaly size? and costs less than $280, and is better?
4. **good sites to find better phones:** what site could we look at once a year or once every 6 months to see that those new phones are better?
5. **cpu where you dont notice anything slow:** is performance noticeably slow under minimal settings for regular stuff on a weekly basis like using google maps? (say you turn off phone animations and other nonsense)
6. **consistent reliable os updates (guess iphone se + pixel is best at this part):** does having os update matter? if so why exactly?
7. **energy:** battery doesnt matter yea? cos that's what powerbanks are for?
8. **ui:** has anyone used all of the main android modified uis recently (within last 3-6 months) and able to compare them?
9. anything else helpful or insightful to know?

853,GooglePixel,"Sorry for the length of this post. I ordered the pixel buds on release day and unfortunately was one of those with bluetooth connection issues while on the go (out for a walk or run or with phone in pocket or arm sleeve). I was the first to post about changing the bluetooth avrcp from 1.4 to 1.6, which improved the connection somewhat but not enough. Google sent me a replacement pair which suffers from the same issues. I’m wondering if perhaps this is an issue with the Pixel Buds and Pixel 3 phones (I feel like several others who have posted with issues also have the Pixel 3).

**Issues:**

If I am at home with my phone resting on a table, the connection is fine (with the occasional quick cutout). I am able to walk somewhat freely around my apartment.

As soon as I go to leave, there is extremely bluetooth stuttering, generally with one bud staying connected and the other cutting in and out. This was extreme when the phone is in my pocket, but still would happen with the phone in my hand or in an arm holder. With the first pair of pixel buds, it was the left bud that generally cut in and out, but with the 2nd replacement pair, it alternates. Also on the first pair, the left bud would occasionally be a fraction of a second behind, causing an echo. I haven't seen this yet on my 2nd pair.

I noticed that after 1-2 minutes of this, the connection generally would stabilize. However after 20-25 min, the connection would start to stutter again, and at this point one of the buds will just completely disconnect (the button not work or anything). This happened to me on both the first pair and 2nd pair of Pixel buds. Both times I took the buds out of my ears, put them back in the case, and then retried them. Neither time did this help. Not sure if my sweat caused this, but when I tried the buds an hour or so later, they worked fine.

**Steps Attempted**

Google CSR Sent the following steps. I attempted them multiple times on both sets.

* Make sure the Pixel Buds firmware version and Play Services are both up to date
* Uninstall and update the Google App from Play Store
* Restart the phone
* Reset the Pixel Buds then proceed to pairing and test

In addition, I did a factory reset on my Pixel 3 to see if that would help (and y’all know how annoying that is to do). I did not. Changing the bluetooth avrcp to 1.6 helped somewhat but not really. I don’t really know what the other settings in developer mode does.

Google sent me a replacement pair, hoping that it would fix it. They have not worked.

Maybe it’s an issue with my particular phone? My friend has a Pixel 3 phone. We connect the buds to his phone to see if he had issues, and he had the same connection issues as I have, which leads me to believe that it’s not just my phone and it’s a general issue with the Pixel 3. 

I replicated the same walking/running/biking conditions with other bluetooth headsets I have and none of them had any issues with bluetooth stuttering, connection dropping, or echo. These include:  


* WH-1000XM3 (best headphones ever)
* Anker Soundbuds Curve Wireless Headphones
* Xiaomi Redmi Airdots ($20)
* Uproar Wireless Bluetooth Headphones

Overall I have been really disappointed with the Pixel Buds. Honestly, they don’t seem to work better than the $20 Redmi Airdots.

I recently bought a Google Pixel 3a and I honestly love the phone. The one thing that is bothering me though... I am constantly losing connection when it comes to phone calls, and will have a call drop at least once during a conversation.

In addition, whenever a call is dropped, I have to either restart my phone or wait a bit before calling back because the call won't go through (I assume until connection is restablished). 

I am by no means tech savvy, but I have had the SIM card switched, taken to T-Mobile to have it looked at, and was told to keep Mobile Data on at all times to ""resolve the issue"", but nothing seems to be working. :/

861,GooglePixel,"I have a Pixel 2, now running the May 2020 security update. A few weeks ago, I started having issues with the pattern unlock- it suddenly stopped accepting the pattern I know to be correct. It doesn't ""lock out"", as in, I can try repeatedly, seemingly infinitely. But even after entering the same (correct) pattern 50 times it may still not unlock. Fingerprint sensor works, but sometimes it says the pattern is required for extra security, and of course the same goes for after a reboot. 

About 2 weeks ago I was totally locked out. I ultimately had no choice but to factory reset via recovery mode. Interestingly, upon restoring my apps/data from my Google backup, it asked for my pattern to confirm it's actually me- and that worked fine! So it's not as though the pattern stored suddenly changed, it's just that Android is temporarily not recognizing the pattern as being correct. 

After the reset, things seemed okay...for about 2 weeks. Now the problem is back. The only solution seems to be rebooting and hoping that after swiping the pattern a few times it lets me in. 

Note that this is EVEN WITH smart lock set to keep my device unlocked at home. 

I contacted Fi support and since my phone is 1 month out of the 2 year warranty, their only solution is to contact ubreakifix, which I can't imagine would be helpful in the case of a software issue like this. Plus it seemingly requires dropping off my phone, which isn't possible when I need it for work.

862,GooglePixel,"Thought there might be a way to do this in the pixel buds app but don't see it. Maybe through tasker? I'm a tasker idiot so would need some guidance on how to do that (a template I could modify at least). 

Use them almost exclusively for music and want an easy way to start playing quickly. Android auto seems to be able to do this easily, so I expect the buds can as well.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: came up with a solution. 

1. Tasker task: launch app (play music), wait 3s, media control (previous, simulate off[maybe should be on?]).

2. Tasker profile: state, BT connected (to pixel buds) using the above task as the target.

You can also set up another task to kill the music app when you disconnect from the pixel buds using a second, inverted profile that recognizes when you disconnect.

863,GooglePixel,"Hi everyone. Just got a Pixel 4 XL for an awesome deal and so far I am enjoying it a lot.

885,GooglePixel,"Howdy all,

I used to have PiP working on YouTube a long time ago, when it randomly stopped (I've never had a yt red subscription, which I hear would have been the issue for some). I thought nothing of it because I didn't use it a lot, I just assumed YouTube got rid of the feature.

However, I was watching a YouTube video in chrome, and that one actually went to PiP when I pressed home. 

So, is there a way to get this back on the official app? I have the setting enabled in the phones settings, but I can't find the setting in the YouTube app.  I've tried changing the alignment/rotation and various tricks involving having the video paused or playing on the minimised bar inside the app. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the app, and I can't see the option for PiP in the general settings inside the app for any of my 5 accounts.

For what it's worth I'm from the UK, as I understand location used to be an issue (but I doubt that's the problem, as it's worked before and works when on the mobile version of the website in the phone browser).

901,GooglePixel,"Hello all.

Have a Pixel 2 XL that I took to Ubreakifix to have LCD screen bleed and non-functional vibration motor replaced, per the promotion details at:

 [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/24/2021652/0/en/uBreakiFix-and-Google-Offer-Free-Pixel-Smartphone-Repairs-to-Those-Helping-and-Healing-on-the-Frontlines-of-the-COVID-Crisis-in-the-United-States.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/24/2021652/0/en/uBreakiFix-and-Google-Offer-Free-Pixel-Smartphone-Repairs-to-Those-Helping-and-Healing-on-the-Frontlines-of-the-COVID-Crisis-in-the-United-States.html) 

Called the local Ubreakifix a few days ago and they stated I qualified and just needed to present my badge. I went in, presented said badge, and they said they would repair everything. Later on that night, they send me a text and state that because the phone had been ""tampered with"" during an alleged previous repair, they cannot honor the letter of their promotion which bars warrantied repairs for ""previous tampering."" I bought phone used so I don't know if it had been repaired previously or not. I read the press release by Ubreakifix again myself and then sent them a copy and also read to them that it states "" An emergency responder or healthcare professional with a Google Pixel smartphone can present his or her ID badge at any of uBreakiFix’s more than 500 participating U.S. locations to receive one free repair, regardless of the device model or type of damage. Common repairs include screen damage, charging port issues, battery replacements, camera issues, speaker issues, and even liquid damage in some cases."" I also chatted with a support staff from Ubreakifix to get a second opinion, and he stated that regardless of the condition of my pixel, whether it had been repaired previously or not, it should qualify because this was essentially an out of warranty repair and the promotional details were worded very liberally. He didn't know why the local store was taking that particular angle and advised me to reach to google, because google would be ubreakifix's guide in terms of repairs.

I chatted with Google support and explained to them the issue and the initial support person was quite supportive, stating that they would set up something with an Case ID that I could then forward to ubreakifix and ""you will be taken care of"" per the promotion details.

I sent the  Case ID  via email to  the uBreakiFix store. They then claim to have contacted Google and then came back and said that if I agree to pay about $300 to have the screen replaced, then they can proceed with evaluating and fixing whatever else is wrong with the phone. I pointed out that this again does not honor the wording of their company's promotion, as detailed specifically in their widely circulated press release. I requested that UbreakIfix conference call me in on with google support on the phone so I could hear for myself and they refused.

I once again reached out to google and advised them of what their partner in this promotion, uBreakiFix, had been doing, and they advised me that the issue had been ""escalated"" to a specialist/supervisor. It's been 3 days since this started. 

I have a collection of google products: Pixel 3, Nexuses (Nexi?), and several tablets.

My experience with Google in the past is that when they say ""escalation,"" it basically goes nowhere.

Your advice please. I came across a ""DMziggy"" while searching for ways to address this issue, but it seems that since then they have closed his support thread.

It seems like at this point, uBreakiFix just needs a clearly worded directive from google worded as ""Fix the phone and honor your promotion,"" and everything should work out.",Pixel 2 XL - need help from Google to approve repair under ubreakifix healthcare provider promo,0,hello all have a pixel xl that i took to ubreakifix to have lcd screen bleed and non function vibrat motor replac per the promot detail at http www globenewswir com news releas en ubreakifix and googl offer free pixel smartphon repair to those help and heal on the frontlin of the covid crisi in the unit state html http www globenewswir com news releas en ubreakifix and googl offer free pixel smartphon repair to those help and heal on the frontlin of the covid crisi in the unit state html call the local ubreakifix a few day ago and they state i qualifi and just need to present my badg i went in present said badg and they said they would repair everyth later on that night they send me a text and state that becaus the phone had been tamper with dure an alleg previou repair they cannot honor the letter of their promot which bar warranti repair for previou tamper i bought phone use so i don t know if it had been repair previous or not i read the press releas by ubreakifix again myself and then sent them a copi and also read to them that it state an emerg respond or healthcar profession with a googl pixel smartphon can present hi or her id badg at ani of ubreakifix s more than particip u s locat to receiv one free repair regardless of the devic model or type of damag common repair includ screen damag charg port issu batteri replac camera issu speaker issu and even liquid damag in some case i also chat with a support staff from ubreakifix to get a second opinion and he state that regardless of the condit of my pixel whether it had been repair previous or not it should qualifi becaus thi wa essenti an out of warranti repair and the promot detail were word veri liber he didn t know whi the local store wa take that particular angl and advis me to reach to googl becaus googl would be ubreakifix s guid in term of repair i chat with googl support and explain to them the issu and the initi support person wa quit support state that they would set up someth with an case id that i could then forward to ubreakifix and you will be taken care of per the promot detail i sent the case id via email to the ubreakifix store they then claim to have contact googl and then came back and said that if i agre to pay about to have the screen replac then they can proceed with evalu and fix whatev els is wrong with the phone i point out that thi again doe not honor the word of their compani s promot as detail specif in their wide circul press releas i request that ubreakifix confer call me in on with googl support on the phone so i could hear for myself and they refus i onc again reach out to googl and advis them of what their partner in thi promot ubreakifix had been do and they advis me that the issu had been escal to a specialist supervisor it s been day sinc thi start i have a collect of googl product pixel nexus nexi and sever tablet my experi with googl in the past is that when they say escal it basic goe nowher your advic pleas i came across a dmziggi while search for way to address thi issu but it seem that sinc then they have close hi support thread it seem like at thi point ubreakifix just need a clearli word direct from googl word as fix the phone and honor your promot and everyth should work out

*Edit: I mention the S20+ in here, at no point do I state that the usage situation is the same, nor do I say I comprehensively tested the battery. I am just making a point that all day battery is dependent upon the person and that unlike what most reviewers say, this phone is capable of lasting all day, your usage may vary.*

So I've seen a lot of posts about the Pixel 4 and people complaining about screen issues mostly. In the UK, the Model I bought is usually £929 but I got it on offer for £759 in April 2020 (128GB XL model).

So to start with, very fast shipping, next day!! Got the phone and sadly got a bad screen, below 50% brightness, the screen became green and got worse even lower down the scale. Now I don't hold this against Google as such, my old S10 had screen issues day one, and an annoying SMS glitch that took forever for them to fix.

So, I'm annoyed, I contacted Google through the Pixel settings app in the support section. I just explained that I did safe mode/restart/factory reset so that the conversation can move along fast. Within 3 mins, they decided to ship me a replacement, copy my data over and send the old one back. I love this service!! Wasn't without a phone at all!

Sadly the replacement had the same green tint. So I contacted the support again, explained instantly that the replacement had the same issue. I requested another replacement to be sent and that they should check for the green tint.

I got the replacement! No green tint! Weirdly I did see a purple tint, I updated the phone with the latest patch (May 2020) since it was on Jan 2020. After that update, no purple tint and certainly not green tint! Phone is in perfect condition, like new! I have to admit, despite the dodgy screen issues, this is one of the few companies (including Apple with my iPad) where repairs or replacements are so damn easy! It was painless and I wasn't stuck without a device at any point!

People forget, on forums, it's always about a phone with an issue, because if your phone works perfectly why waste time saying it on a forum lol. Every phone has an issue time to time, don't let that put you off from this awesome to use phone, Google do uphold their warranty super well.

Battery: I was concerned about battery, 3700mAh, 90Hz on 95% of the time (thanks to the April 2020 update). It only drops to 60Hz at minimum brightness which is fine. The first 3 days, the battery was average, maybe a little worse... 5hrs screen on time. However, this was only because the phone was new, I was downloading so many apps, installing, playing heavy games to try out performance, and overall just heavy heavy use! Not to mention adaptive battery probably hasn't had time to learn my app usage pattern etc.

4th and 5th day of using this phone, YouTube for 3 hrs on and off, Spotify 2hrs, calling 1hr (with my long distance GF if you're wondering why I'm on a call thaaaat long) and little indie games for a bit.

Consistently hitting 6hrs and 30mins, with 17% still to spare. As I'm typing this, I'm on 6% with 7hrs and 44mins screen on time. This ladies and gentleman, is with all features on, lift to wake, tape to wake, motion sense with Spotify (I was cooking), 90Hz on etc. Clearly this phone has more than enough battery for someone who chooses to charge overnight! Even my brother S20 plus dies at the same rate when he uses 120Hz though.

****TL;DR*****: 
Considering this phone at this time, and it's on offer? Grab it! Definitely direct from Google store.

For the past few months I had issues with my pixel's camera. I couldn't take photos or videos clearly as it looks like the camera can't focus on an item and the picture is kinda ""shaking"".
I contacted Google support but they couldn't help me and my device is no longer under warranty so I can't get replacement device.
I replaced 3 cameras (new, original) but it didn't solve the problem. I ordered camera from parts and replace it with  the installed camera and still the same problem. 
I didn't know what else I can do. I decided to open the battery cover and try to solve it myself. And I did. The problem was that there was a tiny dirt on the glass that protect the camera lens and there's a sticker around it that cover the lens in few millimetres.

965,GooglePixel,"The Pixel Buds arrived today and I ran them through some tests, mostly audio comparison tests vs Pixel Buds 1.

WOW, the unboxing and initial setup experience is incredible. I'm surprised reviewers did not mention this at all. It really is a quality experience right out of the box. It's easy, seamless and accompanied by a detailed yet clear and concise onscreen presentation/orientation. My Pixel 3XL detected them immediately when I opened the Pixel Buds case. I havent experienced any connection issues at all.

The case is incredible. You've seen every reviewer fall in love with the satisfying click of the case lid. The click is real. It has to be experienced. It's that good as silly as it seems. What may surprise you though is the weight of the case. Its heavier than I expected. It feels solid. This isn't a flimsy plastic case. It's well made and it does charge on the pixel stand when placed upside down.

The buds fit in my ears well with the default medium tips. You do really need to twist these buds so that they lock into your ears, or at least I do. Your ears may fit better or worse than mine but overall, they lock into my ears quite well and pass the head shake test. I also tried to flick them out of my ear with my fingers and they stayed in place just fine. They are so light in your ears. It's really nice but the best part is no more cord. I'm a pixel buds 1 user so I know that cord well and the awkward way you have to unwrap it from the case then untangle it and wrap the cord over your ears for stability. That nightmare is thankfully no more. I liked the Pixel Buds 1 despite it's issues. I never had the charging case issue and I also did not buy them. I received them for free via skymile points on my credit card. So perhaps I'm not as bitter about the buds 1 as those who paid for them but I found them to be decent. They've served me well on many bike rides.

Lets talks about audio quality. The Pixel Buds 2 are ""bright"". The bass is evident but minimized. These buds are more balanced and focused towards the mid and high end, which bring a nice sense of separation and clarity to the sound. Vocals are clear, and highs are crisp while the bass is evident in a balanced sense... It's not going to impress you if you are a bass addict. The Pixel Buds 2 do sound very nice. A lot of people tend to prefer too much bass in their music and associate it with ""quality"" but bass for the sake of bass can muddy and ruin the mids and highs. Speaking of which... the Pixel buds 1 are much louder and feature much more bass. Those of you familiar with the buds 1 will find the buds 2 to be lacking in volume and bass by comparison, HOWEVER the Buds 2 do sound better in terms of clarity and separation. The bass muddies the sound quality of the pixel buds 1. I do prefer a more balanced audio presentation, known as ""flat"" so I find the Pixel Buds 2 to sound quite good despite the bass not being overly present.

The pixel buds 2 do not get as loud as the pixel buds 1. The Buds 1 are significantly louder than the Pixel Buds 2. Although being that the buds 2 are brighter and have sharper highs, its probably better that they aren't as loud. They do get loud enough at 100% volume but expect to be up around 80%+ volume most of the time.

As for the static issue. It's there, very faintly at the end or beginning of a song (before it plays or right after it plays a song). It's also there on the pixel buds 1 although its more ""airy"" on the buds 1, where as on the buds 2, you can distinctly here a little static for a brief moment. IT DOES NOT SOUND BAD. Not on my set at least. You don't really notice it at all unless you're trying to.

So overall... the user experience, the sound, the case, the pixel buds 2 are a solid buy. They're overpriced for what they are, but I'm happy I own them. They are very nice and I think Google did an excellent job here. Could they be better? Absolutely but they're very good ear buds. They are so light, and fit incredibly well. The experience of wearing them really is a homerun compared to the pixel buds 1 and that cord.... that fucking cord :)  Seriously I didn't mind the cord, as I usually used them while exercising  but not having to fumble around with the cord while putting on the pixel buds on is so much better. I'm very happy with the Pixel Buds 1.

**EDIT: So I'm going to revise my review a little. Latency is a huge issue when playing games with the Pixel Buds 2. Unfortunately the Pixel Buds 2 do not support AptX, and only supports AAC audio. I have a $30 pair of taotronic ear buds that support aptx and they do not lag in games. A $179 pair of headphones should be able to play candy crush. I have no idea why Google didn't go with AptX when clearly there are latency issues with the pixel buds 2.**

**Music and video will not exhibit latency since the video player functions all compensate for the latency to keep sound synced with video but in games, the audio is delayed by half a second or 1 second and that completely ruins the experience.**

**BTW my $30 taotronics also exhibit the static noise issue. I think the static noise thing is a bit overblown since other bluetooh earbuds will exhibit this. I know people say samsung buds dont but there are threads of people complaining that they do too. Still, the Pixel Buds 1 didn't really exhibit the noise as bad as the pixel buds 2. The pixel buds 1 also use AAC like the pixel buds 2 but exhibit LESS LAG when playing games. WTF google. Really? How?**

Also they have latency when connected to PC that puts audio a little out of sync with video. Again my $30 taotronics have better latency.

966,GooglePixel,"I've been experimenting with wireless charging on my Pixel 4 XL for quite a while, but I keep running in to issues where it doesn't seem to fully charge.

When I use the official Pixel Stand, it charges up just fine, but if I use any third party charger (I've tried 4 or 5), it just doesn't seem to work great. It seems like it's got to be positioned *just right* to charge, which basically defeats the purpose of wireless charging. Then, it never seems to charge all the way – I'll set it down when I go to bed, and in the morning it's no longer charging (at ~80% today).

967,GooglePixel,"I ordered a unlocked Just Black Pixel 4 64GB phone online on sale for $499 plus tax, but much to my surprise I received a case of phones (10 in total) from Fed-Ex two days later. - So 9 extra phones (this is important later). I gotta be honest, for a moment it felt like winning the lottery, but it was only a moment as angel on my shoulder, and my wife, both spoke up, and I knew there was only one choice:

I informed Google customer service, with a little tear in my eye of the mistake over through the chat, and I think they were a little taken aback. At first they requested a photo of the packing slip, and then a picture of the extra phones, which I provided - I informed them that I removed one of the phones - hence the picture had only 9 boxes in it. They ask me to wait 3 separate times, and then sent me an email 2 days later letting me know that Fed-Ex would be stopping by to pick them up. The tracking slip only had a quantity of 8. 

Talk about rubbing salt in the wound, but  I contacted Google customer service again to ask them how to proceed. After more deliberation they told me to return 8 and they would send a tracking slip for the ninth separately.

976,GooglePixel,"So a couple of months ago I went from an avid Apple user, to full on Android. And I mean Pixel 4, Pixel C, Chromebook HP x360. So far the experience has been really subpar. 
NOTE: The lions share from this experience is due to the phone not the other devices.

Details:

Pixel 4: 
Love the form factor and build. 

Display is midrange at best, no usability in sunlight (it's sunny where I live most of the time), touch accuracy ist meh at times. Another thing the forehead bothers me more than the notch tbh.

OS - ahh... I love android but there are huge perks missing from ""THE Google Phone"". Random crashes, launcher (stock) refreshes, freezes on lock screen and I'm a guy that has 7 apps installed and other than the occasional Hearthstone does NO games or intensive tasks... I wanted to try Lineage, but that beat the sense in having THE Google Flagship without the software. Honestly for that money amd hype Google should focus on R&amp;D A LOT more...
I have honestly gotten more reliable usage from a 200€ Xiaomi phone - no sh*t!

Battery life: No complaints since I turned off every possible feature that caused lower battery life - but then it hit me, I paid a lot of money for a device that can't even hold up a day with the FACTORY built in and enabled sensors.

Pixel C: 
By far the most pleasant experience I've had on a tablet running android. Fast, reliable, snappy and battery life THE BOMB!
From media consumption to office work - really good ipad replacement if on a budget.

Chromebook: An okay device, just blown up android apps are not for me.

The sync consistency between the devices has been meh at best. I use them for work and private and everything except Calendar has dissapointed me on more than one occasion.

I tried Samsung on the s10, as a second device just to see if maybe that works better and it did but I dislike the design language and feel of the devices.


All in all, a lot of compromises for the freedom of changing my launcher.

Apple you will have my money again.

TLDR; Switched from full Apple to full Pixel/Google and it was crap. Back to Apple.

981,GooglePixel,"First, I'll admit that I've only done cursory research but skimming through various reviews, this question doesn't really get addressed.  The new Pixel Buds look like they seal in the ear canal completely.  For those that have been using them for phone calls, virtual meetings, etc., do they give you that feeling like you have ear plugs in when you're talking?  It's that sealed-in feeling where you can't hear the outside world very well and your own voice sounds strange to you since you're not hearing yoruself normally?  It's hard to describe...

I've been satisfied with my 2 year-old Jabra 65t earbuds except that I can't stand that feeling when I'm talking with them in.  With so many more phone calls and virtual meetings because of COVID-19, I'm using them a lot more than I have in the past for that purpose.  Instead of getting used to that feeling, it's starting to drive me crazy.  So much so that I've gone back to an ancient Jawbone headset for calls because it feels more like talking on a normal phone.

988,GooglePixel,"I'm going crazy. Literally since I took them out of the box, I've had the same issue with my Pixel Buds paired to my Pixel 4XL. When I'm walking, they randomly pause. Or randomly play-pause-play-pause. I can't find anyone else posting about a similar issue, but if I missed something, please let me know.  

This should be the ideal pairing. Latest Google phone. Latest OS. I made sure the Pixel Buds updated to the latest firmware. I work in IT fixing people's Computers all day and maybe I'm tired/just want my brand new headphones to simply work correctly.


Here is everything I've done to troubleshoot:

1.) Factory reset them with Google Support and the issue still continues. To do this, the case has to be plugged in to charge, and then press and hold for 30 seconds with the buds case open. (this is no where on the support pages. The support rep walked me through it.)

2.) Turned off Google Assistant Integration. Problem still persists. 

3.) Turned off In-ear detection. Problem still persists. 

4.) Disabled motion controls on my Pixel 4XL.
Problem persists. 

5.) I paired the Pixel Buds to my MacBook Air 2020. No issues what to do ever. 

6.) I paired the Pixel Buds to my Pixelbook Chromebook. No issues what so ever. 

7.) Paired with old Pixel 2XL - Same issue persists.

8.) My 2 year old Jabra Elite 65ts work perfectly fine and with no issues on my Pixel 4XL. The issue only seems to happen with the Pixel Buds. 

Am I missing anything here? Everything else about the headphones is fine, but if I can't walk down the block with the Pixel Buds, I'm just going to go buy new Jabras instead. I've had a support ticket open for over a week now, and still no resolution in sight.

Right after I got the phone I noticed the plastic power button, it's going to fail in no time for sure. Looks like Google can't figure this problem out since Nexus 5. Both Nexus 5 and 5x's power button failed on me, the one on my OG pixel got so sticky as well, except this time, I broke the screen first.

This got me thinking  on what could I do to prevent it from failing, then I remembered some apps I used when the button on my Nexus 5 broke (Yes I didn't fixed and found ways to use the phone without it ). Screen Gravity, This app unlocks the screen when it detects the phone is outside your pocket or moved from a horizontal position to vertical, it uses the proximity sensor and other sensors to work, and for locking the screen I used a double tap feature built in into the custom Rom I was running. ( when the battery dies, I turn it on via PC with Nexus root toolkit ) 

The issue with solutions like these on a modern pixel is that you cannot use the finger print to unlock the phone when using an app to lock the screen, in order for the app to work you need to give an admin permission, which basically means the screen is going to admin locked and you can unlock it only with the pin and that's a pain in the ass.

I upgraded to a Pixel 4 from my old Essential PH-1 (which still works, just a bit slow).  Purchased the Pixel 4 on 4/25 with the sale price using Synchrony financing, with the phone arriving on 4/29.  After a few days with the phone, I really enjoy it, but I think I made a mistake by only getting the 4 instead of the 4XL.

I am still within my return period with Google, so I can still send it back for a refund (minus shipping and a $35 restocking fee).  However, in the time it will take to send the phone back, and await my refund, the current sale on Pixels will expire, and I won't be able to afford the XL at it's normal price.

I really would like the 4XL, and I don't mind going back to my Essential for a few more weeks or so if needs be.  Does anyone think that Google will enact a permanent price drop on the 4XL anytime soon, like with the release of the 4a or anything?

1047,GooglePixel,"Yesterday I wrote [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/gek5h2/pixel_performance_visualized/) post comparing the progression of the performance in Google Pixel devices since the Nexus 6P. Also giving some theoretical idea of future performance. A user asked me to add some Pixel 3a data to the mix. Unfortunately I did not have the time to make more bar graphs but I did add the math to some new charts.

*\*\*If you would like to read about the flagship SOC data then head over to my previous post linked above, otherwise I will ONLY be talking about the A series and how it compares to the MAIN pixel line in this post.*

Links to Charts:

[OG Chart](https://imgur.com/W7J7fJc)

[Pixel 3A Chart](https://imgur.com/xfkR01T)

Note I made 2 charts that show how much SLOWER the A line is to the Main line, BUT I also made a chart that shows how much FASTER an 865 Pixel 5 could be. The math is reversed when doing faster vs slower percentages, and the numbers cant be reversed, therefore I made 2 charts so that you could get both sides of the picture.

Things that stand out is how the Pixel 3A was only able to beat  the OG Pixel in performance numbers. (note benchmarks aren't indicative of IRL performance FEEL). A theoretical 765G chipset in a pixel 4A wouldn't be much faster either. As a mater of fact if a Pixel 5 with an 865 series chipset was to be released, It would absolutely DECIMATE a pixel 3a, and be almost 2x faster than a 4a with a 765G. This just proves my point that buying a year old flagship handset is still a smarter long term choice than buying a budget phone. I have never bought a budget phone, I have always opted to wait for sales or wait a year for a new model to get last years flagship.

This is backed up by data. Example: You could have bought a Pixel 3 on discount once the pixel 4 came out. But some waited for the 3a hoping for a ""lower priced pixel"". In the end a used Pixel 3 would cost about the same as a New Pixel 3a, however the 3 Would be significantly faster. Some are ""waiting"" for a Pixel 4a, but in my opinion, It is smarter to just buy a half off Pixel 4 which is ALREADY significantly faster than the 765 (or any possible 700 series chip) and simply disable soli.

This is NOT a post claiming that the Pixel 5 will have a 865 chipset (although this is most logical and most likely).

""But the 865 is more expensive than the 765!"". Yes, but its not enough to cause a phone to go over the 1000$ mark. Look at the OnePlus 8 Pro. Its still at or under 1000$. The phones that are being released with the 765 G have already announced pricing at sub 450$. Unless the pixel 5 is sold for 650$ or less with a 765 and has bleeding edge hardware like 120hz displays, it will have an 865 for around 800-1000$. Someone told me it will be over 1200$, this is relatively hard to do with googles design philosophy but I won't discuss this here. These are all rumors, theory crafting, leaks etc. I stand by my logic that an 865 Pixel 5 makes perfect sense at around 800-1000$ and a 765G Pixel 4a at 400$.

Now, the reasons that the 670/765 are that much slower? Lets dive deeper:

1. Half the memory bandwidth of even a snapdragon 835
2. Dual channel memory controller vs Quad channel
3. Less CPU cache
4. Only 2 High performance cores (and 6 low performance) unlike the 800 series that has 4 high performance cores)

This is honestly all it takes to kill a cpu's performance. This is backed up by how Desktop CPU benchmarks can greatly fluctuate with different ram configs and speeds. This is also how the Desktop GPU market segregates its GPU tiers using the same Chip but slower memory (See RX5600xt vs RX5700). If a chip can't be fed enough data, it simply wont perform. The 670 also only has 2 high performance cores, meaning PEAK performance will be HALF of the 845 of its big brother Pixel 3.

As for the 765. Many thing that just because its a 700 series that its faster than a 600 series and gets close to an 800 series. This is FALSE. The 700 series in some way is even more compromised than the 600 series. It uses 1 high performance core, and 1 medium performance core and 6 low performance cores. This boosts efficiency and battery life ALOT but its a compromised design to using 2 high performance cores and 6 low performance cores. Sure it is still faster because it uses a newer A76 based CPU design vs the older A75, but if it was using the older A75 it wouldn't be faster than the old 670 chip. The 700 series isn't at all higher tier than a 600 series. It again has less than half the memory bandwidth (17gbps vs 44gbps on the 865). It has a MUCH slower GPU, again less than half the speed. The parts where the 765 outshines the 600 series is in the modems and ISP. Its image signal processor is significantly faster, and the modem is capable of 5G and gets within spitting distance of the 800 series.

Hope this makes sense. You can find all of this info online to check for yourself. I'm simply consolidating it into something easier to understand. Enjoy

EDIT:

Also, since some thing that the 4a may have a SD730 chip. One I think this is plane stupid as it offers no real upgrades of the 670 other than efficiency, and Two, I'm giving the 4a a ""best case scenario"" approach. Imagine an even slower chip. HA!

1073,GooglePixel,"Three years ago I made the switch from Apple to Android and I'm so happy I made the change. I've really fell in love with my Pixel 2 XL for its simple, refreshing OS experience, beautiful display, and solid camera. However, its age is starting to show - I've recently been experiencing horrible battery life (dies around afternoon-evening daily), dead pixels, sluggish performance, and random GPS errors.

Now is the time for a new phone. I've narrowed it down to two/three options: the OnePlus 8, or the Pixel 4 XL / Pixel 4a XL (which is to be released soon). I'm really partial to the simple Android experience that the Pixel offers, but I've read a lot of solid reviews on these new OnePlus phones and how the OS is very similar in simplicity. The other factor is 5G and whether I really need it or not. On one hand, it would be nice to be future-proofed and have access to faster speeds. But on the other hand, 5G isn't readily available everywhere yet. Is it a must-have if you're going to be spending good money on a smartphone in 2020?

**OnePlus 8 (5G ready)**

Through Verizon, I can get $350 credited to my account by trading in my old phone, free 5G access ($10/month value), and a $150 Verizon gift card. Payment would be $33.33/month for 24 months, not taking into account those discounts.

This phone has the best processor of the bunch and is 5G ready - also has the best battery life. Seems like the OS is very similar to the Pixel's, so that's a plus to me.

Camera seems to come up quite often as a negative in reviews, but that's not necessarily a deal breaker for me. Would probably still be an upgrade over my Pixel 2 camera. Display also seems pretty average at 1080x2400, 402ppi and I'm not sure if the curved edges will bother me or not. Aesthetically speaking, it's not my favorite looking phone. I prefer the simpler matte design of the Pixel phones.

**Pixel 4 XL (4G)**

It's currently on sale for $599 on Google's website, or $24.96/month for 24 months.

As I mentioned before I loved my Pixel 2 XL and its OS, so this was the first phone that came to mind. Seems to have a really nice QHD display, a really nice camera, and I'm absolutely in love with its design and how it looks. That said, even at the discounted price its specs seem to be pretty average. I've also read a lot about the poor battery life which isn't ideal.

**Pixel 4a XL (rumored to be 5G ready)**

It's supposed to be around $499 or so for the 4a XL version, though not sure. Rumored to come out sometime this month I believe.

If they include the Snapdragon 765 5g processor in this phone, it could be the cheapest 5G device out there. It's also rumored that the battery will be improved this time around.

1074,GooglePixel,"As of writing this: the 3a is sitting at $399 (but will probably be lower when the 4a comes out) and a few vendors are selling new Pixel 3 at the same price (Amazon has the pink version for as little as $330!).

Do you think it's logical to switch from a OP6 (128gb / 8gb RAM) to the 4a?

I think the downgrade in specs won't be an issue for me because I don't really push my phone to it's full limits i.e gaming ect ect. I also don't care too much about the camera, although I'm hearing good things about the 4a and the software behind it.

Occasionally it would be problematic, as the phone would ring while I'm on a Microsoft Teams call and the phone would ""steal"" the connection from the laptop, but otherwise, it worked flawlessly.

I was dissappointed to learn the Pixel Buds only supported one connection at a time, but nonetheless I thought it would be manageable, BUT the connection between the Pixel Buds and my laptop is awful. When I connect the Buds I get two playback devices (Chewbawacca's Pixel Bud Stereo, and Chewbawacca's Pixel Buds Hands-free AG Audio) and the laptop never selects the right one for playback. Inevitably in Teams meetings, the audio will just inexplicably drop out and I can't hear anyone and they can't hear me, even though the Buds show connection.  I end up switching back and forth between the two playback devices to sometimes fix, but more often I end up falling back to my 65t.

I posted here a month ago asking for some advice and I am still searching. The Pixel Buds came out but I think the price point is too steep for what they offer. I'm looking for buds that are: comfy (I know this is subjective), good for running, okay for calls, and slim profile in case. So, as of right now, I am looking at the following earbuds:

\- Jabra 75t: I can get them renewed on Amazon for $120. That's the most I would want to spend. They seem solid overall so these are frontrunners.

\- Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2: I don't love the airpods looks but they seems solid and good for calls which I like. I also like the slim profile of the case. The price is way less than the Jabra's right now ($80 on Amazon) so if these are comparable, I would probably go with them. I have heard about connectivity issues...

\- Fiil T1X: I originally ordered these but the company that ships them is having issues from COVID so I have no idea when they would actually come. I requested a cancellation and am moving on to other options that I can actually have shipped!

1124,GooglePixel,"I finished up most of my work at the office yesterday, so today I got bored and decided to see what the actual performance change was for mobile. Even though it seems to have ""stagnated"", I think that it has hit a similar issue as our PC components. Even though the performance has increased, the workload has become more complex and requires more resources to achieve similar performance to yesteryear.

So...I made [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/kXSa9BZ) little chart real quick.

As one can see, there has been a steady performance change over time. The worst increase being the multicore from the 6p to the Pixel 1 XL. This is due to cutting the amount of cores in HALF, while increasing the single core performance by 27%. There was almost a relatively small 15% increase in single core performance from the Pixel 1 to the Pixel 2. The biggest performance gains so far came from the Pixel 4 which is roughly double that for the 6P the Pixel line replaced.

Interesting things to note. If the snapdragon 820 didn't cut its number of cores in half (and using an average 3.77 multicore to single core coefficient) then the 820 8 core score would be 1229, a 40% mutlcore increase from the 6P. This would be in line with the Pixel 2 which was an 80% improvement over the 6p (this equates to roughly 40-45% gains per year vs baseline).

Why the big jump from the 835 and onward? Well based on some research I conducted, there are 3 main factors that contributed to this.

1. Node shrink (from 14nm to 10/7nm)
2. Changing from Dual channel to Quad Channel memory. Since increasing memory speed requires more voltage, the choice was made to increase memory bandwidth by doubling access channels.
3. Doubling CPU cache as well as adding a L3 cache in the 845 series which reduced memory usage significantly.

Also, about the snapdragon 865 that could be in the pixel 5. Using numbers from the galaxy s20 (single core 839, multicore 3104 AT BEST). The pixel 5 would be ONLY a 12% improvement single core year over year, and 15% improvement multicore YOY. This would be the smallest YOY change to date in processor performance. The 865 also offers support for LPDDR5 quad channel memory which lowers the required voltage for memory. The biggest improvement in this SoC is going to be the GPU which increases ALU's and ROP's by 50% while still lowering power consumption.

Of course, I digress, processor performance isn't the only thing that matters in a smartphone, but it is pretty important (as well as ram latency, bandwidth, gpu efficiency, overall efficiency, etc).

Hope this was interesting.

1129,GooglePixel," So, about two months ago, I dropped my Pixel 2 XL pretty badly. It was inside of a case, but it fell pretty hard on a tile floor.

About 15 minutes later, the screen started blinking on and off, and then eventually the screen came up saying that I needed to factory reset the phone.

I did this, and then the phone worked fine...UNTIL I tried to restore the phone from a previous back up (saved about 12 hours before the dropping incident). After this restore, it would begin the screen would begin blinking again and I would be asked to do the factory reset again. After going through this cycle a few times, I just accepted that I wouldn't be able to restore my phone, and went about reinstalling all of my apps, changing back all of my settings, etc. It took me all morning to do and I lost about half a day of work productivity (working at home due to COVID 19--my phone is very important for work).

Fast forward two months to now. Last night (I think?) my phone battery died while I was asleep. I woke up, and put it on the charger, and I came back to it about an hour later. When I turned it on, it was blinking again and asking me to factory reset it. I didn't drop it or anything. Again, after trying to use a saved backup of my phone, the blinking would continue. So, I tried restoring a from a back-up of my phone, but NOT restoring settings and features. This worked. However, I still lost about half a day of working, and it was a big pain in the butt.

Does anyone know what's going on here? How can I prevent this from happening again? I've had this phone for about two years (almost have it paid off!) and it's been dropped quite a few times. Hoping there's a solution other than having to deal with it or buying a new phone.

1135,GooglePixel,"Hi All,

So due to my diabetes I have had to upgrade to an iPhone 11. It's a long story but it involves looping and can only really be done with an iPhone with the setup I have. I thought it'd be fun to do an exit style interview/review like when you'd leave a company.

**So what made you buy a Pixel and what model did you have?**

I was an iPhone user since the original. I had the 2G, 3G, 4 and 5 and then switched over to android. The Samsung Note 4 was my first droid and it was great but the battery life was horrible. Next up we had the HTC 10 - I wanted those front speakers and it was great, until the battery crapped out after about 1.5 years with it. I decided on the Pixel 3 XL as the camera looked amazing and like the rest of us wanted that stock android experience. I went with the 128GB model but quickly realised that 64GB would have been fine.

**How was your experience with the Pixel 3 XL?**

I loved it. This was the first phone that I was sad to see go on the day of the upgrade. Usually upgrade days are happy and filled with excitement. The excitement was there but nothing like times passed. The problem was that the Pixel 3 XL was still a great phone with an amazing camera. Sure it had it's quirks like the speaker profiles at different volumes but other than that it was an awesome phone.

**Any regrets buying the 3XL on launch day?**

Not really - as a UK user though I have been really disappointed by the lack of call screening - even after 1.5 years it's still not there? This seems to be an ongoing theme that Google are totally focused on the American market (I still can't get the Pixel buds 2 for example).

**Is the Pixel 3 XL still viable in 2020?**

Yes it is an I'd implore you to check it out as an option if you're trying to pick one up second hand.

**You said you were sad to be upgrading, can you explain further?**

Usually when upgrading I'd be to the point where I'm 100% done and fed up with a phone. Usually it'd be the battery or laggy performance that would have wound me up to the point of driving over the phone with my car. But the 3XL was different. I didn't need to upgrade and I'd have been totally happy using the phone until the end of it's life. I will miss the unlimited photo uploads that are automatic the most I think. I'm so used to taking 50 photos in 5 mins just because I can - that'll have to change with the iPhone.

**Would you ever come back to Pixel?**

I totally would - my experience has been top notch and I didn't ever have any problems - I know there are a lot of people who have had issues but for me it's been painless. If there's an option in the coming years to loop using the setup I have for my diabetes on Pixel, I'd be back in a heartbeat.

**How are you finding the iPhone 11 so far?**

Well it's not my Pixel 3 XL but it's been pretty good so far - haven't had the same excitement I had when setting up the Pixel but it's been ok. iOS and Android are quite similar at this point with a few differences. I miss being able to swipe as a back button though, a lot of iOS apps don't support this and you have to go hunting for the back button. The camera is decent and I've taken some really good shots. Switching over to the gesture navigation on the Pixel when it came out has really helped the transition. 

**If you could give a message to this fantastic reddit community what would it be?**

Thank you for being awesome and forming part of my morning read on Reddit. I've shared your pain and excitement over the last 1 and a half years and I look forward to reading all your posts on here in the future.

1162,GooglePixel,"Just before I start, I have a Pixel 3XL, before I got the buds I set the AVRCP version to 1.6, and the buds have been on firmware version 225 since I got them(not sure if they were like that out of the box or if they updated immediately after I set them up, cause I put them right back in the case for the drive to my house.) I've been using the original BT Pixel buds, and rarely used the USB-C buds because frankly, I didn't like the sound from those or the wire. I got these yesterday at about 4PM but have used them a lot since then, probably a total of 6-7 hours.

Edit: I didn't realize, but the bluetooth audio codec I'm using is AAC, not system default (whatever that is)

&amp;#x200B;

As an aside, this post is over 3000 words long, the equivalent of a 10ish page MLA format paper, and took me 2 hours to write, so I'd grab a drink and a snack if I were you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Setup:** Incredibly easy. Just pop open the case, get a banner at the top of your phone screen, tap on it, go through the tutorial if you want, give it access to assistant, change the size of the buds if you need to, whatever. Compared to the old Pbuds, which were supposed to have fast pairing (which I never got to work), these are great.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sound:**

\-Media: They don't seem quite as full as the original Pixel buds, nor do they seem to get quite as loud. I wish Google would add some EQ profiles as well as something to fiddle around with where you can adjust it to your specific preferences, but really these are no slouch. I've already heard some details in my music that I wasn't able to hear before, but at the same time, the bass doesn't seem like the warm, low noise I've become accustomed to. After reading that soundguys post I might fiddle around more with the size of the tips, because apparently that can change what you hear by quite a lot, but these are just initial impressions. I've listened to some classical music (Shostakovitch, Mennin), some funk rock (Primus), and some alternative/antifolk/glam pop (of Montreal) and I was never disappointed with anything but the bass heavy stuff, and even with that you quickly forget that it's lacking until you listen to other headphones.  I may be biased toward bass heavy speakers/earbuds though, because in my car I set the EQ profile to a V shape, and maybe the original BT buds were bass heavy as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also watched a lot of video (movie on my pixelbook, some youtube on my phone and my pixelbook, videos on twitter mobile), and the audio seems to be pretty good there as well. There's a very tiny delay between what I see on the screen and the audio, but it's barely perceptible. I'd peg it at a.1-.2 second delay.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really get any hiss, which I actually got a decent amount of on the OG BT Pixel Buds whenever the drivers were activated, and which annoyed the hell out of me. I've tested it on youtube videos and Shostakovitch 11, which has a lot of very quiet sections, but no podcasts yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The vent they have to reduce the plugged feeling and allow some noise to come through works pretty well. With audio turned off/way down I can hear people talking easily, but my brain can't filter through loud music to understand speech for some reason, a problem I've always had (not with lyrics, I'm not sure why), but I can hear that speech is happening outside the buds up until about 2/3rds volume before it's a challenge. I can hear the sound of cars driving by on the street up until 80%, then I have to be actively listening for road noise to hear them. A downside is I can hear myself singing along to my music too well. Adaptive sound is nice, but I've only noticed it happening when I flush the toilet and the reservoir is filling back up/I'm washing my hands. Maybe it's happened other times, but I haven't noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick edit: I really went for it just now when pushing these things into my ears, with the small tips, nothing crazy, they're still comfortable but bass seems a LOT better now. The beginning of the song Gelid Ascent by of Montreal has a very low hum in the beginning that's normally difficult to hear unless you listen for it actively, and for about a year I didn't even know it was there despite listening to the song dozens of times, but this time I wasn't even listening for it and I heard it. Color me impressed. Everything is still nice and clean, but the bass is definitely more present now. The sound also feels more full.

&amp;#x200B;

**Comfort and fit:**

The longest I've worn these continuously has been 3 hours, during that time, there was a little bit of discomfort, but nothing too serious. I would say the wingtip/""thorn"" is the thing that causes the discomfort. When I first put them in I can tell that they're there, but I forget about them pretty quickly. As for the fit, they're great. I went for a run this morning and really went for it at the end, breaking into a borderline sprint. I didn't have to adjust the buds the entire way, something I would never be able to say for my old Pixel Buds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mic quality/calls:**

For some reason, I can't get parrot to record audio through these, even when I set the app to prefer bluetooth devices for audio capture.  I did notice that it said on the app that audio recorded through bluetooth would be recorded at 8000hz, whereas audio recorded on my phone mics can go up to 44100hz. This, I think, is the reason why on all the mic tests we hear for bluetooth earbuds, audio quality is just gross. It's true that in the verge mic test the buds were the worst, but I feel like even if they are the worst out of the ones tested, they're all capable of much better sound recording. Maybe I'm an idiot though and don't know what I'm talking about. The Google recorder doesn't let you record audio through the buds for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

For calls, they're great. I've been in my car with the AC blasting, walking outside near a roadway with wind, and inside my own quiet house and on all these calls people reported solid call quality, whereas with the original BT buds people would tell me they had trouble hearing me, and a few of my friends even made fun of me for the call quality, so certainly a step up here.

&amp;#x200B;

Google assistant picks up my voice well, hasn't misheard me once, even when I was wearing mask at a crowded Walmart.

&amp;#x200B;

**Connection:**

Like I said, before I began using these I set my phones AVRCP version to 1.6 in the developer settings, and have not had any connection issues with my phone. I first tested them by leaving my phone in my room on the Pixel stand, and walking around the house, and then outside. It's a medium sized house, and I probably went 40-50 feet from the phone without the buds disconnecting. Problems only arose when I went to my fridge and had the fridge in between the phone and myself, and when I went around the far side of my car from the buds. They don't like having tons of metal/electricity between them and the device they're connected to, big surprise.
[This is where I tested](https://imgur.com/a/gMxBTxx), held went to the center of the lot as far from everything else as I could get, nothing for maybe 20-30 feet in any direction but the trees you can see, a maintenance worker kicked me off the field. Held my phone behind my butt used my other hand to block one earbud at a time, turned my head, no disconnects. 

&amp;#x200B;

The buds stay connected to one another very well regardless of where I am, whether it be in a parking lot, running across a bridge with a wide road on one side of me and a sheer drop-off into a canyon on the other side, crossing the street, whatever. I've cupped my hands over both buds when I was inside too in an effort to make them disconnect and it's only happened once even when cupping both buds tightly. Tomorrow I might run into the middle of a field just to confirm that the connection is decent in all situations. Worth mentioning, I had my phone in my right hand the whole time I was running so it wouldn't shake around in my workout shorts, but I'll test further on that bridge with my phone in back/side pockets later.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real connection issue I've had is when I connected the buds to my Pixelbook and for some reason it kicked them off, and after that I had to reset the buds in order to make them connect to both my Pixelbook and my phone. I also tried to pair them to my old Windows laptop today with no success, but that thing isn't doing too well, so it might be the computer/my ineptitude.

&amp;#x200B;

**Battery:**

Yesterday wasn't a great day for battery on these. I began testing the battery at 6:20PM and by about 8:30PM the one with lower battery was at about 20%. I didn't check the notification because I had dismissed it, but in quick settings it only reports the battery of the bud with lower battery so I don't have detailed info about yesterday. I continued to wear them until half after 9, and they didn't die, but I didn't check the battery on either of them after. I've also noticed that the algorithm which Google has talked about that's supposed to help the buds trade off jobs doesn't seem very aggressive at all on my buds, and I have done a reset for that. As of writing this, I've had them off the charger for an hour, listening to music nonstop at 70-80% volume, and the left bud has 68% battery to the right buds 90%. Yesterday and this morning the right but was the one draining faster, so hopefully they average out over time such that there's not uneven battery wear on them. The average of the two is 21%, so assuming they switch at the right time, it's conceivable that they could hit 5 hours of playtime, or even more with lower volume.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the battery in the case, for a while it was only reporting 100% after charging the buds up a little bit. I thought it was broken, and I reset it last night. Maybe it was a bug, but I'm also finding that the case doesn't drain very quickly at all when charging the buds. I charged the case up w/o/ checking the battery level on it prior after I finished using the buds last night, which I wish I hadn't done so I could get a more accurate idea of how much battery it lost charging the buds after the 3 hours of listening, but today I'd estimate that I've used the buds for about 2 hours not counting the more recent hour, and I haven't charged the case at all. I just checked, and it was at 88%. 12% missing from 2 hours of charging. With an advertised (I think) 19 hours of battery in the case, 2 hours of charge is about 10.5% of those 19 hours. Extrapolating with some math, that looks like about 16.6 hours of actual charge time in the case, at least for me. I took a few calls and I've been playing my music loudly though, and using the assistant some, so maybe I'm just unusually hard on the battery and the 19 hours holds up for the average consumer.

&amp;#x200B;

The Buds charge in the case so quickly that I don't even care to check if it's as fast as advertised (others are saying it is). I know that I'm never going to have an issue with the buds being out of battery for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

Another quick edit: It's been another hour since I wrote the battery section, left bud 32%, right 78%. Kinda pissed that the algorithm still hasn't kicked in, but there's still time, especially seeing that one drains at roughly 3x the rate of the other, so if they switched right now they would even out at about 10%. Maybe they're just screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

6 minutes after that, left bud is at 31% and the right is at 76%. Another minute, staring at the percentages, left 31%, right 75%, Looks like the algorithm just kicked in. I'm gonna keep listening and see if they end up at around 10% at the same time, then I'll edit this post. As it stands I'm finishing up the final section prior to TL;DR (Obviously needed) and I don't want to wait 2.5 hours to post this.

&amp;#x200B;

They lasted 3 hours and 57 minutes. Left bud died first when right was at 4%. Waited for the right to die, and now after 20 minutes in the case it's at 82%, which I think is outstanding. Left, which had an extra 5 minutes of charging on the right one, is at 85%. So like phones, the buds charge rapidly at first before slowing down significantly as they near a full charge.


New update: Just went for a morning run, my connection test from this morning is already posted with a picture of where it was done. My run started about 40 minutes ago, I just checked the buds battery. I had them at 100% volume the whole time because I want tinnitus. They're both at 84%. Seems like they're draining evenly now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Design and build:**

I think they look great, the buds are lightweight, the case feels solid, I love how it snaps closed, I love how the buds are pulled into place by the magnets, I love how small the case is, I love ALMOST everything about the design and build, except that the case picks up dark marks easily (though you can rub em off with your fingers, jeans, whatever), and I don't like that the lid has about a quarter to a half a mm of play from right to left whether it's open or closed, but it's infinitely better than the case of the original buds, which always felt and looked like it was about to snap in half.

&amp;#x200B;

The lights they included are a big step up. For those who don't remember the original buds had 3 lights, all of which were on the inside the case, side by side, and they served double duty in reporting the battery of the buds and the case. You had to click the button in the case if you wanted to get the battery of the case, or the battery of the buds, and sometimes it got confusing. On the new buds you have a light inside the case which gives you the status of the buds, and a light on the outside of the case which gives you the status of the case. The old case also misreported the case battery all the time, and I had to shave off a lot of silicon from the buds to get the metal contacts on the buds to stay connected with the case. Even after that, the buds often came disconnected from the case and paired to your phone while they were in your pocket. I've had to pull over so many times to disconnect them so I could keep listening to music in my car you wouldn't believe it. I have had no issues like these with the Buds gen 2.

&amp;#x200B;

The buds 2 protrude from my ears a tiny bit, and I don't really want to lie down on a pillow with them but if I did do that it wouldn't be a huge issue. Compared to the original buds, these things are tiny and very attractive. My only real wish is that you could unscrew and replace the mesh cover with a new one. Traditionally, when the mesh gets waxy I've taken blue tac to my earbuds, but on the original buds that ended up tearing out the mesh cover of one, and I had to use a needle, tweezers, and superglue to reapply it. A replaceable mesh cover would eliminate the need for blue tac, and keep me from getting too worried. As it stands I've been cleaning out my ears before using these when I remember to and they've remained pretty clean. I don't have super waxy ears or anything, but when I get really busy with school, making sure I clean my ears isn't at the forefront of my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intangibles:**

I went through hell getting these things. My family can see my bank account and I don't have a ton of money, so I didn't want to order these on my card or else they'd be on my ass about it, but I did have a good amount of cash on hand, so I went and picked up a prepaid visa card from Rite Aid. It took like 5 hours to get the thing activated, I spent a ton of time on the phone on hold, hanging up, calling again, and researching ways to fix it myself because I feared I would never actually be helped.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time I thought I would be moving into a new place the next day, so when I ordered I ordered from beach camera on April 30th, and their site said I could have them delivered by May 1st, so I dropped the extra $19 for 1 day shipping, and they ended up being about $207 all together. The website was wrong, they shipped the next day, and they only arrived yesterday on Monday, and their customer service refused to reimburse me for the 1 day shipping despite the site giving me the wrong info.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, May 1st, the guy I was supposed to be moving in with ghosted me after I had taken apart all my furniture and packed my stuff up. I tried to get in contact with him about the package, but he ignored my texts, and if your packages arrive at another person's house, that person owns them, so I spent 7 hours sitting in my car with shitty AC outside this guys house in the sun yesterday so I could intercept the FedEx driver and show them my ID before he got the buds and was allowed to keep them.

&amp;#x200B;

Gas cost for the car idling all day so I could run my AC + extra shipping cost was $34, and 7 hours of discomfort and boredom, plus the opportunity cost of not using that time for school.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all that, and losing time I could have used to work on school work, I still feel like these were worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final thoughts, speculation:**

So my right bud just died, after the left died 5 minutes before it. When the left died the right had 4%. That's a total time of 3 hours 57 minutes. By the way, having plugged the left bug into the case at 7:52, it's at 33% right now 8 minutes later. The right bud after 4 minutes of charging, is at 21%. I'm not sure about this, but given Google's history of doing staged rollouts of features and A/B testing, it's possible that they're testing builds which prioritize connectivity over battery life and vice versa. Or maybe the battery life is only cut down cause of my phone settings, or how I was using the buds. Anything is a possibility with Google though. Just an aside.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Easy setup, awesome sound, comfortable, good call quality for me and the people on the other end, strong connection, decent battery(though when the algorithm takes forever to kick in it's worrying), ultra fast charging, spectacular build and design, and the best purchase I've made in a long time in terms of value.

1168,GooglePixel,"Hi all,   


I've had my Pixel 3 for about 18 months at this stage &amp; never really encountered any issues with it. I keep it exclusively in a case and, with the lockdown, decided to take it out recently for a clean and because I was mostly using it just around the house. It was then I noticed that the back panel was splitting away from the frame, particularly in the middle, so I did some research online. Most things I could find suggested it was a battery issue and was pretty common on Pixel 3 devices; apparently it swells and thats what pushes the cover off. It can be quite dangerous (eventhough there was no issue with the phone itself) so I followed the advice of discharging it and then not charging it again.  


Either way, I decided to contact Google directly about it and went through the usual of sending photo evidence/providing info and they agreed to give me a replacement if I posted it to them. I got two options: i) Have a phone sent to me and a hold placed on my account until I sent my phone back or ii) Send my phone back and when they'd received it, they'd send a replacement out.   


I went with the second option, because I didn't want anything on my account, and they replied with a DHL booking form/label. I packed everything, but when I visited DHL to post it I was told they couldn't, as there was no account number on the booking. Put simply (after an hour of trying to contact Google) the booking wasn't attached to any account, so I'd have to pay directly for it to be sent or it'd just be sent back to the holding office. I left and contacted the Google team and they said they would investigate and get back to me - this was around 10 days ago. I contacted them again yesterday, about 8 days on, and was told they were still ""looking into it"".  


Could anyone offer me any advice or have they had similar experiences? I've been without a phone for most of two weeks now &amp; I don't get how they could issue a packing label without knowing their own account number with DHL? The staff at DHL were really helpful and I don't think it's an issue on their end, several people looked at it and came back to the same conclusion.

1172,GooglePixel,"So far I am in love with everything about the Pixel Buds 2 (connected to my Pixel 4XL).  

The only gripe I have is the bluetooth delay in certain applications (for example: Twitch - *moderate delay*, Hearthstone - *major delay)*.  For some reason (perhaps naively), I thought that Google making a truly wireless earbud, designed with the Google Pixel in mind, would equal some Google engineer magic with bluetooth connectivity.  Now I know that it is mainly up to the developer of individual applications to account for audio sync and delay issues, but I am just venting (was waiting for the release of these for a long time).  

Unfortunately, the delay is as bad on Pixelbuds 2 it was on my old Bose Soundsport wireless as it pertains to certain applications.  The delay is *much* less on my sennheiser Momentum 3 headphones (I'm guessing due to Aptx LL?), but over-the-ear all the time can get a bit cumbersome.

Firmware is installed without our input at all and it took me a couple of tries to get the buds to update. Just putting them in their case didn't seem to work after ten minutes so I decided to test the wireless charging for a minute and when I checked they had updated to firmware 225. 

After the update the sound had improved greatly and the buds are now on universal volume. 

The sound quality is what you would expect for $180 ear buds. My Bose Soundsport Free have better sound, but horrible battery life.

When I try with little pressure when moving my finger slides and I change the volume. When I increase the pressure it pushes the mic into my skin and it can't understand me.

Better hybrid zoom to 10x.(For better perspective and composition)

Real time video  and viewport bokeh effect.(For better composition on the spot)

Ultrawide that supports micro mode (something like one plus)

Ultra accurate bokeh cutouts (people dont realize it but bokeh is the second most important DSLR feature)

Customize bokeh more, customize bokeh bubbles, paint out inaccurate cutout on google photos, export depth map on third party apps like lightroom or photoshop or snapseed.(This will help a lot exclusive mobile photographers, or hobbyists)

&amp;#x200B;

Sound: Honestly they're extremely neutral and have been pleasing to the ear so far especially compared to my 2018 Gear Iconx's. They aren't the loudest but meet a good middle ground for what I would prefer anyways. Bass is in the background and 'there' but not loud or as present as I've experienced before. I'm not an audiophile but I haven't really found myself missing anything from the experience since the rest of sound seems well rounded and clear.

\*Hiss So I heard it a lot before the update to 225 and then it died down and is either not there or incredibly minimal\*

Fit/Comfort: It's subjective to your ear of course but I genuinely think Google knocked it out of the park. They're lightweight, fit immediately (the rubber isn't noticeable) and look great. I feel like this is a universal approach to try to meet as many people's ear shapes as possible and appreciate the design.

Battery: It looks like these hit right at the 5 hour mark Google was saying give or take 30 minutes for different use scenarios. Between the case and the buds I haven't been worried about running low and they both charge fast which helps.

Bluetooth: So here's where it gets a bit tricky. My first day was riddled with the right earbud constantly cutting out while i was walking around with the phone in my hand. Then I updated to version 225 the following day and it switched from the right earbud going out to the left. But it definitely didn't happen as often and as of today (5/5) I haven't noticed any issues whatsoever indoor or outside. I was going to rma but if it it sticks then I'll be fine. Fingers crossed.

Google Factor: As someone who uses the google assistant in my home and for day to day outings these are hands down the best investment i could've wanted. Having Google with me constantly and having it working EVERY time has been a pleasure. It just works which is great to say.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall: If the buds hold up connection wise (and I expected issues buying these the first week in, once i updated to 225 and noticed that the situation changed it proved it was only software related) then I'd consider this the upgrade i wanted for myself. Thats it y'all thats the tea.

1233,GooglePixel,"So I'm ""stranded"" in Colombia right now. Canadian. I got a friend a bit back just as lockdown started to buy a used but brand new pixel 4 128gb and ship it to me.

Phone - $720 (Cad)

Shipping - $109 (Dhl)

Customs.. $370 (Colombia)

Crazy. I literally got this in my hands the week after the country went in to full on lockdown, roads closed between cities. I paid the high government ransom tax of $370 with my credit card and as soon as I did boom, they drove it cross country 12 hours and delivered my phone. I swallowed the cost quickly, it was ridiculous but whatever though, given the state of things I was lucky to get my hands on this phone in this. 

Now for my unanswerable question:

I'm staying in a nice big place for this lockdown in arguably one of the country's best neighborhoods in a place with I have 50mbps internet. BUT all the essential apps that are of more importance than ever right now, load insanely slow. And it only happens inside this apartment with this provider.

Rappi - South America's uber eats/skip the dishes/food delivery co name - can take 2-3 minutes on average to get a quick orders in, or 5-10 just order a few waters or tequila or whatever.

Tinder- 3-5 minutes to load. Wayyy too long.

Google Translate - not working at all. Voice hasn't worked for awhile. Recently texted stopped completely. I'm using a .dict app now. Far less efficient but forces you to learn more I guess. No reason for this not to work.

Pimsleur antiquated language app, 4-5 minutes. Maybe that app itself just takes that long though.

It's crazy that a cutting edge Google phone is taking minutes and minutes to load basic apps. I went by a friends place a bit back and the apps loaded immediately, he had 100mbps internet though.

It's bad enough I'm considering moving, from a proven  safe and good place during this lockdown - just to hopefully get situated in a spot these fucking essential apps will load in reasonable times for my new daily house arrest life.

It's not like don't have the time, just don't want to deal with it. Do you guys think factory reseting the phone would fix the load times on these? If so I'm willing to do it.

1244,GooglePixel,"So my wife and I switched from Verizon to AT&amp;T awhile ago, and none of the new phones interested her so she just brought her Pixel 3 with her. I signed up for AT&amp;T's insurance since it was in good shape. Well sadly it got stolen a few days ago so it was time to file a claim. When I originally filed the claim online it said my replacement device would be a Samsung Galaxy S8. Oh no no no, that's not remotely comparable! I worked for AT&amp;T a long time ago and their insurance is supposed to give you a comparable phone or better. So I called their customer service mentally preparing to have to fight them tooth and nail this. I politely explain the situation and how that phone is almost 2 years older than my wife's pixel 3. I explain that we are big pixel fans and would really just rather have another Pixel 3. She explains that unfortunately AT&amp;T never sold the Pixel 3 officially so they can't give me that, however she offers to send me a Pixel 4XL instead.

I'm like hell yeah! At first i'm concerned because I thought i'd get hit with the maximum deductible, nope! Since my wife's phone falls in the BYOD category it's only $125 bucks.

1266,GooglePixel,"For the record, I was an Android user first and then switched to iOS. I used to have the Motorola Backflip, the crazy phone that comes with Android 1.5 (now it is Android 10, see how many years have passed!). That crazy phone's alarm would never ring on time, which is just an example to tell you how terrible the software and hardware integration and optimization was back then with Moto( no wonder they got sold and resold...)

I really really like Google and Android. For example, the Google Duplex is really cool. I actually ask my Google Assistant to call restaurant s for me (though it didn't succeed...). And I have been an iOS user for years. I guess I am getting bored about iOS even though it is really fluid. When I saw the price drop for P3 on Amazon (got it for $400).  ordered one. 

I really like it that I can do more with Android 10, like split screen for two apps(which I really like). But as someone who has been using iOS for years, I still struggle to understand why Google couldn't optimize the Pixel experience to be on par with iOS . I know I might get criticized by you guys. But I just want to start a discussion about how Google can improve their product.  

One small example about the difference is the text cursor. In iOS, the cursor can be moved by pressing hard on the space key on the screen to enable 3D touch/Haptic Touch. On Android 10, you can use glide typing gesture on the space bar to move the text cursor, however, only horizontally, which I don't understand. Why doesn't Google just walk the extra mile and just make it able to move anywhere?

I like Android and I hope I can stay on Android platform. This is just a late night question for me and hopefully you guys can share more thoughts on this.

1273,GooglePixel,"*(Edit: Full review added to the post instead of linking off)*

After reading a lot of questions and feedback in here about various aspects of the [Pixel Buds 2](https://nickdenardis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/google-pixel-buds-2.jpg) I decided to write up what my first 48 hours have been like with them.

I have no comparison to other wireless earbuds but work at a computer all day on calls, record podcasts, and an avid runner.

This is my take as an average new user and address my experience with some of the things others have been mentioning, hissing, connection, mic quality, connection to a Macbook, etc.

\-----

## Appeal

Wireless headphones have never been my thing. I’ve had numerous wired headphones though, from the [Apple in-ear](https://www.apple.com/ie-business/shop/product/ME186ZM/B/apple-in-ear-headphones-with-remote-and-mic) to [Sony in-ear](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/dp/B00JRD13T8) to the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/us/product/usb_c_earbuds). For me, it’s all about how secure they are in my ear while on a long run.

The appeal of the Pixel Buds came from using assistant with the USB-C earbuds, it’s just so convenient. For context, I’ve never tried the original Pixel Buds or any other wireless headphones.

## Fit

Decided on the smallest pads. The medium size seemed fine, but after having them in for more than an hour at a time, I found the smallest ones were the best mix of fit and ability to hear talking when audio is paused.

They are seriously light though, it hardly feels like there is anything in your ears.

## Audio volume

At first, they felt pretty quiet, but after some adjusting, they seem only slightly on the quiet side. There is definitely something odd about the volume controls though. At times it felt like there were two volume controls while connected to a Mac. The output volume works like normal, but then there seems to be a separate Buds volume that is controlled through swiping. Sometimes they update in sequence, but with the Mac volume all the way up, I can still turn up the Buds by swiping until they top out. Not ideal, and probably a bug, but it may be why some people feel they are quieter than they should be.

## Swiping and touch controls

These feel completely natural and work really well. On two occasions though while running and trying to turn the volume up it thought I long-pressed and read me the time and all my notifications. This could have been due to sweat, but it was unexpected.

## Battery life

To be honest these (or any in-ear headphones) are not something I would want to wear all day long. I am on calls for 3-4 hours per workday, but I haven’t yet had the chance to see how long I would keep them in.

Spend the second day doing a ton of yard work and had them in \~40% of the day. Feels natural to put them back into their case when not in my ears and the longest amount of time wearing them only reduced the battery to 40%.

They come fully charged out of the box and after 48 hours the case is still at 38%. Even if I traveled a lot and wasn’t able to get to a charger each night, the amount of battery seems on par for what is reasonable and I likely wouldn’t spend more for a higher capacity battery.

## Adaptive sound

So far so good on this front. It is nice to hear conversations around me without have to take the Buds out. While running next to a loud road the sound did turn up automatically and then back down when it got quieter. While mowing the lawn it did the same. I would say the feature is pretty helpful but found myself still adjusting the volume between podcasts and wish the adaptive sound would equalize the output audio instead of assuming all audio is already equalized.

## Microphone

I’m used to recording audio on my computer with a podcasting mic. This one was a bit weird for me to wrap my head around. While connected to the Pixel 3 XL and making a call outside in a windy environment the person I was talking to said I sounded normal and they couldn’t hear any wind at all, which was great.

I make a lot of calls from my computer though, a 2017 Macbook Pro 13″ with Touch Bar. This is where things get complicated. I tried to record the mic and got some really horrible results similar to [Tech FireSide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcqkhyYvpa8). But realized it was only because Mac OS was doing some sort of downsampling only while recording, the actual call quality was really good.

After listening to someone else talk on them from the Mac or phone I can say the mic really is high quality and on-par with a wired microphone.

A real world test after a full work day will be telling though.

## Connection quality

Connected to the Pixel 3 XL the connection has been great, I was able to walk a good \~30 feet away inside and \~100 feet outside with no regression in the audio quality. Connected to the Mac though I was surprised the range was only about 15 feet at best. Apparently the 2017 Macbook Pro only has Bluetooth 4.2, which severely limits the range.

When moving from the Pixel to the Mac and back and forth multiple time the speed was fantastic. Only two or so seconds to disconnect and reconnect.

Some people have reported one or both Buds cutting out with head or body movement. I’ve run multiple miles with my phone in a [SPIbelt](https://spibelt.com/) and cut the lawn with my phone in the pocket with no cutting out from either earbud.

## Google Assistant

Something I’ve struggled with is going truly voice-based for all interactions. With the USB-C pixel earbuds, I was able to hear all notifications and they were read to me. I could prompt this by holding the mic button and it would read the time and then all unread messages.

Without the cord and with my hands dirty I’m looking for a way to do the same but with only my voice. I’ve tried the recommended “read my messages” with mixed results. I have checked my app notification settings and all the relevant ones are on.

I still haven’t found a consistent voice command to have Google read me all my unread notifications without touching the physical buds.

## Firmware update

It took a few times of taking the Buds in and out of their case and then leaving them alone for them to update then report their new version. There was no audible sound or notification to let me know they were being updated or that the update was complete.

## Hissing

I have not experienced hissing when connected to the Pixel 3XL, even when listening to audio at the lowest volume. As soon as they are paired with the Macbook Pro though there is a noticeable hiss when in-between apps/music but it seems to silence itself after a second or two. Definitely not noticeable or a dealbreaker and feels like it is coming from the computer instead of the Buds.

## Overall

The first two days have been wonderful. I don’t have a lot of context to other wireless headphones but compared to the wired ones I’m used to the Pixel Buds are great. I’ve found myself leaving them in my ears more than their wired counterparts.

I mostly listen to books and podcasts but the overall sound quality is great although if I really wanted to listen to rich music I would opt for over the ear headphones any day.

For me, the largest sell is the ability to access the Assistant and everything on my phone with voice.

1280,GooglePixel,"So I've seen a few posts already about leaks of the upcoming Pixel 4a and I devided I would collect some information here. A bit of a disclaimer up front; I cannot guarantee that any of this is acurate information but by the ammound of articles and leaks I have seen, this is what I would expect it to be. Also I am not a journalist or proffessional, just a 20 year old from Germany that is very exited for this device.  


[early renders of the Pixel 4a that are still holding up](https://preview.redd.it/74prw80o2tw41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9b458afb4346893bf7fc8b3fd50ebf62530e05)

The Pixel 4a will be the next budget oriented phone, suspected to be revealed around the 12th of May and shipped by the 22nd this month. This is based on when the Google I/O event was first supposed to take place and leaked shipping dates of the german phone carrier Vodaphone.  


Design wise it will feature a 5.81 inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 60Hz refresh rate, cutting the 90Hz from the Flagship Pixel 4. The 4a further features a hole-punch 8MP selfie camera and will not have the motion sense features included in the Flagship. Face Unlock will therefore also not be present.

On the back the 4a will have the same 12MP Camera that the past 3 Pixel's featured, housed in a similar Camera-bump to the Pixel 4, though it won't have a second camera. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor will also make a come-back for this phone.  


For the specs we're expecting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730, a still mid-ranged but still powerfull chip, that is supposed to rival the performance of the 2 year old Flagship Sd845.

From what I've seen people can't really decide whether this phone will come with 4 or 6GB of Ram and if it will feature 64 or 128GB of storage. My bet would be on 6 / 64GB though, at least for the lowest, $399 starter price. There could be a 128GB model available for a slightly higher price.  


[leaked billboard renders suggesting a $400 pricetag](https://preview.redd.it/sximphfu2tw41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c09f73a700639200a31d9ff0133bb612bdbc316)

For additional feature's, we're sure to get a headphone jack again and no wireless charging or IP-certified water resistance. It will also only come with 4G and not 5G technology.

I've been dealing with connectivity issues with my Pixel Buds with my Pixel 3. They seem to work fine while I am in my apartment, but as soon as I left for a walk or run and put the phone in my pocket, it would cut out so much (left bud completely, right occasionally). I've always had issues with echos.

I was playing around in the Developer Mode settings on my Pixel 3 and saw where the 'Bluetooth AVRCP Version' was set to '*AVRCP 1.4 (Default*)' on my Pixel 3. I changed this to *AVRCP 1.6* and I noticed that this actually improved the Bluetooth connectivity on my Pixel Buds significantly (there are still cut-outs and echo, but significantly less).

Are the other Bluetooth settings in Developer Mode that might improve this? Anyone else want to try this and see how if it helps them?

UPDATE: Well, that fix seems to be short-lived. Yesterday they did pretty decent, but I just tried going on a walk and after about 5 minutes the left started continually stuttering/dropping out. And then it would come back in and be fraction behind, causing an echo effect. Sigh

1319,GooglePixel,"Apologies to the mods if this doesnt fit here but I'm seeing multiple people posting about issues they're seeing with their new buds, none speaking about my issue specifically.

Purchased the product a few days ago, finally came last night in shipping. I opened the box, tested the buds, no issues except the annoying buzzing that google support tells me is [completely normal](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/439520001657929739/706952461386121266/unknown.png). 

This morning I take them off the charger to begin listening and I notice the the right ear piece outputs no audio. It still responds via bluetooth, I can still operate media controls, in ear detection works, hell even the microphone still worked.

During a lengthy conversation with google support telling me to reconnect the device in different ways I accidentally drop the right ear piece. I pick it up and I can hear audio playing. 

My mind is racing as I begin to drop it over and over from about a foot onto my desk and note the audio randomly going in and out after each drop. Seems to be a loose cable internally and dropping it will reseat/disconnect the cable.

After some testing I let the support rep know and he escalates my case as its confirmed to be a hardware/design/production issue.

Now I'm still waiting on their tier 2 to get back to me but I promised a video demonstrating the issue and how I go about ""fixing"" the issue by beating it like Bob Ross's paint brush. I figured I'd share it with you too since it could be helpful and doesn't seem to cause any damage to the buds themselves (depending on your beating method)

1339,GooglePixel,"[Plots](https://i.imgur.com/moMvli0.png)

I let the buds drain; this resulted in the right bud draining to empty while a the left bud still had 10%.  I then put them in the charging case and tracked the charge status at 1 minute intervals for the first 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes until the buds reached around 80%, then every minute after that.

* **They get about 20% charge in the first 5 minutes!!**  Then about 40% within the first 10 minutes.  This really is in line with Google's claim of 2h of use with 10 minutes of charge.


* From 0% to 100% took 47 minutes


* They charge most-rapidly up until about 80%, then charge rate levels off reaching 100%


* The case lost 18% to charge both buds back up, it should provide 5 full charges to the buds

The buds charge seriously fast.  Compared to my Galaxy buds it's not even a competition.

What is also interesting to note from this data is the discrepancy of power use between the buds.  I posted a thread yesterday about drain after an hour of use, and there was a 20% difference between the buds after an hour.  I guess this evens out over longer usage.

At the same time, with one bud dying and the other still having 10% left, you don't get the full usage out of them, which is a bit frustrating as a consumer.  On the other hand, personally, I never really use headphones for more than maybe 2 hours straight, and the fast charge rate means I never really have to worry about them (I don't know how long it took to drain, I just set them to play when going to bed and came back to them in the morning; on retrospect I wish I had set them to play back with long video, then I'd know how long it took based on where the video paused at...).","I tracked the amount of time it took to charge the new pixel buds from ~empty to full, here is the result!",0,plot http i imgur com momvli png i let the bud drain thi result in the right bud drain to empti while a the left bud still had i then put them in the charg case and track the charg statu at minut interv for the first minut then everi minut until the bud reach around then everi minut after that they get about charg in the first minut then about within the first minut thi realli is in line with googl s claim of h of use with minut of charg from to took minut they charg most rapidli up until about then charg rate level off reach the case lost to charg both bud back up it should provid full charg to the bud the bud charg serious fast compar to my galaxi bud it s not even a competit what is also interest to note from thi data is the discrep of power use between the bud i post a thread yesterday about drain after an hour of use and there wa a differ between the bud after an hour i guess thi even out over longer usag at the same time with one bud die and the other still have left you don t get the full usag out of them which is a bit frustrat as a consum on the other hand person i never realli use headphon for more than mayb hour straight and the fast charg rate mean i never realli have to worri about them i don t know how long it took to drain i just set them to play when go to bed and came back to them in the morn on retrospect i wish i had set them to play back with long video then i d know how long it took base on where the video paus at

I have looked around, but none of the solutions online seem to be relevant or working. I would like to set the Facebook Messenger App to vibrate only. No sound, just vibration. Meanwhile I do not want to set my phone to silent, so just silencing everything is not an option. If I long press on the App, go into App Settings -&gt; Notifications, I either turn the app quiet, or turn on sound and then additionally turn on vibration. (I am really confused who could have ever thought this to be a good idea.)

My only idea right now is to just upload a silent audio file as custom ringtone, but it is kind of an ugly fix.

Help? :D

Edit2: Solution didn't work, the messenger just resets to defaul. So I just put a silent.mp3 in the Notifications folder, and set it as the tone. Lets hope it works.

Edit: SOLUTION:

Apparently if you go into the Android sound settings for the App you can select ""no sound"" as a ringtone which is hidden in ""My sounds"" (long press -&gt; Info -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Chats -&gt; Expand options -&gt; Sound -&gt; My sounds -&gt; silent/no sound)

1343,GooglePixel,"There are 2 issues specifically.

The first is the Google Play system update vs. Security update. Why are they separate? Bundling them together under 'software update' will make it so much easier to update (and my phone doesn't even check the Play system update automatically, it was on December when my security update was on March).

Second, why does 'optimising apps' take so long when installing a software update? It took 15 minutes for this process to finish on even the May 2020 security update which was a puny 8MB. In fact, for the March update which was considerably larger, it took well over half an hour. This happened on my old Galaxy as well, but I recall it being much faster and happening after the update is installed. My iPhone on the other hand updates within 10 minutes, mostly around 5 minutes or less - why does it take so long with Android, especially Pixel phones?

1353,GooglePixel,"After receiving my pixel buds 2 with the insane static issue in the right earbud, I've really just had enough of Google pushing out half-baked products with what seems like no quality control.

I'm a die hard Google Pixel fan, (love my 3A XL), but it seems that we the consumer, and oftentimes the most faithful of us, are left bearing this cross of being Googles QA team and PAYING to discover all these bizarre issues with no real recourse.

Google customer support is notoriously shit. Like, beyond fucking shit. I loathe the idea of having to reach out to them. And then we're just left biting the bullet of a product that doesn't work as intended.

I know this is super rant-y, but man at some point enough is just enough. Get it the fuck together, Google.

For the 31% of folks down voting this post, (I get it, this is Reddit, we're in /r/GooglePixel), just wanted to give more info showing this isn't an isolated incident for just the few, (wish I had seen these articles prior to purchasing), and reinforce the idea that we absolutely should be holding Google to a higher standard since we all want to see these products continue to rollout and get better.

1369,GooglePixel,"Hi all,

I just bought a s10e on Samsung's website. I love the phone, but the battery is not ideal. I'm in the US using the snapdragon version and been getting 4 hours of SOT roughly, which is okay I suppose. I've now been using it on the medium power saving mode and yesterday got 5 and a half hours of SOT, which is much better. However, using the s10e on the medium power saving mode makes the phone less 'snappy' and it feels more like a mid-range phone in terms of its speed and processing power.

I'm still in the return window for the s10e, so I'm thinking about returning it and getting the Pixel 4a when it comes out (hopefully in the next few weeks?). I'm assuming the 4a will have a better battery, same size screen (5.8 inches), better camera, and will last longer in terms of updates (I like to own a phone for three years and Samsung told me I'll get Android 11 and 'maybe' Android 12 (but probably not).

Since I use the s10e on medium power saving mode (where the cpu is at 70%), I don't think I'll see a huge difference between the phones in terms of its speed, and I'll get all of the advantages of having the clean, stock android on the Pixel (the Samsung One UI is pretty much loaded with crap imo).

1380,GooglePixel,"Hello everyone

I just bought the Pixel 3a a several months ago and I have an annoying problem with the gallery.  
So I do a lot photo editing on my computer, upload it to Google Drive and download it on my phone. So far so good, but if I open up Google's Photo App, the photo doesn't show up immediately. Thus I downloaded an other photo album app and there the photo appears immediately.  
The problem is, a lot of apps like Whatsapp go through Google's Photo app if I want to share a picture, so it's pretty annoying to always open up the other photo album app first and share it from there, some apps don't even allow you to do so and it's such a pain to wait until the photo finally appears in Google's Photo app.

1418,GooglePixel,"I got this device just to mess around with stock Android and I ended up enjoying it more than I thought it would! Coming from using mostly iOS products, I do think that the Pixel could (and most definitely will) replace my iPhone! The UI is very smooth and is well designed over OneUI (imo) which is what I was using on my Note10+ before I went and got a 11PM. The phone feels great in the hand but I'm not a big fan of the fabric cases that Google sells as it's too slippery for me. Battery life on the 4XL is good. I'm getting around 5/6 hours SoT but my 11PM was and is a beast at battery life. Pixel has rapid charging and wireless charging so I can justify that. I'm still in the beginning stages of owning this phone so I assume once the phone is calibrated to my usage, this will get better. The Pixel Launcher works very well in my opinion. Not too feature backed but enough where you can change a few aesthetics like text font, icon design, and quick toggle colors. Using Nova launcher on my Note got me a little overwhelmed with how much you could do with it so I do enjoy the ""here's what you get"" type mindset. It works so I'm not upset at all! The camera on this phone is amazing and I'm really surprised how you zoom in the viewfinder and how high resolution the photo can be compared to snapping and cropping in post. Gestures work better compared to my Note's gestures that came with Android 10. The 90hz display is very nice but I don't see that much of a difference just by looking at it. Animations and text scrolling is very smooth though compared to the 60hz on the iPhone. Exclusive features Google puts like Call Screen works like a charm and is definitely a way to save time. 

TL/DR: the pixel is the iPhone to Android. Everything works together and is well thought out.

1422,GooglePixel,"So, when the Pixel 4 was originally released, the camera setup was largely praised for the most part. 

I mean, you still had the odd commenter point out that the picture quality from the Pixel 3 to the Pixel 4 didn't really seem like that much of an upgrade, and losing the wide angle selfie lens was definitely an inconvenience, but largely the camera setup was still praised for being the new gold standard.

However, other than the camera set up, the rest of the phone was absolutely ridiculed to death, the poor battery performance was usually the headline, as it almost always is on Pixel launch day, and then of course you had the running commentary on how much of a gimmick the new touch-free gesture system was, the only real positive I can remember other than the camera on Pixel 4 launch day was the face unlock.

Fast forward half a year and it's now time for the budget Pixel 4a to be released, like last year, the Pixel 4a is largely expected to be a do-over for the Pixel 4, a chance for Google to iron out any major issues they had with the Pixel 4 and try and repackage it into a more financially friendly device, and like last year it's set to feature the exact same camera setup as the previous flagship release.

Over the last couple of days all I have heard is how brilliant the Pixel 4a camera is going to be, all of the leaked samples are doing the rounds around the internet, people are talking about how it's going to be a real competitor against the new budget iPhone, the tech community is truly a buzz with the new Pixel 4a camera setup....But, here's the thing, it's not a new setup, it's the exact same setup that took a back seat to the face unlock when the Pixel 4 was released.

What I'm getting out here is very simple, I feel like all of the best features that a new Google Pixel flagship has will always be undermined by the perceived negativity surrounding each new device, and by the time Google release their budget do-over mid year, all of those great features from the original flagship I now moved over to the budget device, and it's all people talk about, because there's no real downside to paying half of the price for almost the exact same features.

I myself don't particularly like budget phones, I will always prefer the Pixel flagships to their 'a' variants, so for me at least, it's just a little bit offensive that people are getting so excited for features and specifications that have existed on the previous Pixel for at least now half a year.

Where was all of this excitement and all of this talk when the Pixel 4 was released, price tag side, why couldn't we focus on how brilliant the camera setup was when it was actually debuted on the Pixel 4, why did we have to concentrate on all of the downsides of the Pixel 4.

It just doesn't make any sense to me.","So, the Pixel 4a is PROBABLY going to have the exact same camera setup as Pixel 4, if that's the case, how come everybody is losing their mind over what a brilliant camera setup it is, but the Pixel 4 received nowhere near that type of reception upon it's release?",0,so when the pixel wa origin releas the camera setup wa larg prais for the most part i mean you still had the odd comment point out that the pictur qualiti from the pixel to the pixel didn t realli seem like that much of an upgrad and lose the wide angl selfi len wa definit an inconveni but larg the camera setup wa still prais for be the new gold standard howev other than the camera set up the rest of the phone wa absolut ridicul to death the poor batteri perform wa usual the headlin as it almost alway is on pixel launch day and then of cours you had the run commentari on how much of a gimmick the new touch free gestur system wa the onli real posit i can rememb other than the camera on pixel launch day wa the face unlock fast forward half a year and it s now time for the budget pixel a to be releas like last year the pixel a is larg expect to be a do over for the pixel a chanc for googl to iron out ani major issu they had with the pixel and tri and repackag it into a more financi friendli devic and like last year it s set to featur the exact same camera setup as the previou flagship releas over the last coupl of day all i have heard is how brilliant the pixel a camera is go to be all of the leak sampl are do the round around the internet peopl are talk about how it s go to be a real competitor against the new budget iphon the tech commun is truli a buzz with the new pixel a camera setup but here s the thing it s not a new setup it s the exact same setup that took a back seat to the face unlock when the pixel wa releas what i m get out here is veri simpl i feel like all of the best featur that a new googl pixel flagship ha will alway be undermin by the perceiv neg surround each new devic and by the time googl releas their budget do over mid year all of those great featur from the origin flagship i now move over to the budget devic and it s all peopl talk about becaus there s no real downsid to pay half of the price for almost the exact same featur i myself don t particularli like budget phone i will alway prefer the pixel flagship to their a variant so for me at least it s just a littl bit offens that peopl are get so excit for featur and specif that have exist on the previou pixel for at least now half a year where wa all of thi excit and all of thi talk when the pixel wa releas price tag side whi couldn t we focu on how brilliant the camera setup wa when it wa actual debut on the pixel whi did we have to concentr on all of the downsid of the pixel it just doesn t make ani sens to me

2020 = Pixel 4a = Sony IMX363, 12.2 MP, f/1.72, 1/2.55"", 1.4µm, DPPDAF, OIS + EIS, 27mm

For 5 years, the camera sensor hardware has almost been the same (nearly identical). This has been a bit disappointing for me.

It in fact reduced from \[1/2.3"", 1.55um\] to \[1/2.55"", 1.4um\] when moving from pixel 1 to pixel 2 (maybe for the DPPDAF Portrait mode enabling feature).

The pixel 5 may again come with the same sensor of IMX 363 which would be pretty disappointing OR they might upgrade it to **\[IMX555 1/1.7"" 1.8um\]** which would be a good upgrade but still feels sorta incremental.

What you guys think?

What are the areas the future pixel phone cameras can make serious improvements in? (Capturing super Fast action? Much better color science? HDR video? Improved slow motion? Super high ISO? 5x zoom periscope cams?...etc.)

Do you feel the next huge h/w upgrade and leap of the camera sensors and tech would come in the Pixel 5 or 6?

1436,GooglePixel,"Tl;Dr at the bottom

First off I'm sorry for another of these posts, but I hope it will be informative. 


The comfort level is immense. They are way less intrusive than the Galaxy buds and quite a bit lighter. They do not feel like much at all. The 'thorn' I find way more comfortable than the wingtips on the Galaxy buds, but I don't think the Galaxy buds wingtip was uncomfortable. 


Next up is features. The passive noise thing is basically on the perfect level, it is very helpful when you have music paused or are not playing something, but when music is playing it is not noticeable at all. **I do want to mention the hissing.** For me, the hissing or white noise only occurs for ~2 seconds tops after pausing music and after that is silence.

 I have not been able to test out Ambient mode yet, but I will update this post if I do. 


Next is touch controls. While not customizable, they are the best I've seen on an earbud. The answering and declining calls is easy and intuitive, having volume controls is phenomenal, access to Google assistant without wake word and notifications, and the normal gestures on top are standard and work well.


The notifications are great. They do not start speaking as they come in. Instead, when you are ready, you touch and hold any earbud until you hear a chime, then it will read you the time, tell you if you have Dnd on and then it will read you your notifications, pausing to let you reply hands free to messages. You can also touch and hold an earbud and start talking - while holding the bud- then release when you are done talking to use the Google assistant without the wake up word. 


Next up is the actual Google Assistant integration, namely how good is it? I have not used it much but there are a couple things I feel a need to mention. I was surprised, but you can send texts, call people, start music or podcasts and use Google assistant routines all on the buds. Another note: when using the wake words, it will answer on your buds first -everytime. That is honestly the best. The google assistant integration on the buds is great by my experience.

The sound quality is good, but I'm not great at audiophile reviews.

The case is incredibly smooth but solid, it doesn't feel fragile at all. The case magnets are also very strong both on the lid and the bud holders. 


As many others have said, the fast pairing is great and so is the in ear detection.

TL:DR The buds are extremely comfortable, sound great and include amazing Google assistant integration. The case is also very solid and feels great. The touch controls and notifications are also implemented very well. I think they were totally worth the wait.

EDIT: If people did not know already, you can translate by saying 'ok Google, help me speak [language]' and you do not need to have your phone open or on the translate app to translate other languages, you just can't reply without the translate app.

EDIT 2: Something I haven't seen people touch on yet is the chimes. The ones for when it's in your ear, when the volume goes up or down, if you skip a track answer a call. Take out an earbud, play or pause, etc. The chimes are really well made and they feel very Google. It's the small things like that that enhance the experience.

EDIT 3:
I also found out that you can mute the volume with your voice by saying ""Ok Google, mute"" It will continue playing what is on your phone, but the volume will be muted. You can unmute by turning up or down the volume on the buds with a swipe.

1437,GooglePixel,"Oh. My. Lord. I absolutely love the fit, feel, and sound of these things. I'm not sure where to start.

The feel of the case is premium and when you pop the lid, the look of the buds placed in the cradle to charging is also premium feeling and looking. The setup was seamless and easy. Within seconds everything was connected and working.

When I popped them in my ear, they have a very very comfortable fit. Way better than the Galaxy Buds which I still think fit very comfortably now this Pixel Buds take the #1 spot of comfort/fit. It feels like nothing is there. These things WILL NOT fall off when working out, biking, etc.

The sound quality is FANTASTIC. I'm not an audiophile but I'm close to being one. I still need to learn a lot more. I've owned a lot of headphones and AMPs/DACs ranging from $200-$600. But the Pixel Buds sounds very good. It has a fun tone to them. I've never owned IEMs but as I keep saying, these sound just right. I don't notice any bad quality.

The one thing that annoys me is with these reviewers is them saying that there's no bass with these. I don't know what they're talking about but these have bass. It's not like Skullcandy bass/head rattling bass. It's present and you feel it but it's not obnoxious and doesn't ruin the vocals or instruments. For the bass, I tested it with the song Wavybone by Pimp C  and Styrofoam by $uicideboy$ and the bass is there, trust me. Then I tested out songs by CCR, Fleetwood Mac, Doobie Brothers, and similar bands and the sound quality is just great. It's what you get out of a pair of $180 earbuds. I can't stress enough the sound quality. I'm using YouTube Music (256kbps AAC) and Amazon Music HD (16bit/24bit).

1454,GooglePixel,"First and foremost- when I can get the Buds to fit well, they are truly great. 

With that said, I am struggling to get them to stay in my ears **consistently**. I have tried every size tip as well. Is there a specific way I should be putting these into my ears? It may sound silly, but if someone could describe how they are doing it in detail, I would greatly appreciate it.

I've had no issues with other wireless buds. For some reason, when I put these in, I get this ""feeling"" they are slowly coming out (almost as if I feel the wing tip about to pop out from the secure spot in my ear). This feeling is usually validated because the wingtip does come out from under the spot in my ear after a few seconds or after moving. Even when I think I get a good placement, it I jump up and down or jog around the room aggressively, they definitely won't stay in and even feel like they're moving. I need to be able to trust the fit of these while walking in public with both hands preoccupied, knowing they won't fall out. But I don't think I can right now.

Anyone else feeling the same way? I use them primarily for calls so I manage to make them work, but it's be great to not even have to worry whatsoever while I have them on. I also own the Jabra 65t Actives and have zero issues with keeping those securely in place (I could be on a pogo stick and those wouldn't come out of my ears).

My experience was much different and ran into issues that I decided it required its own post. 

Data: [https://imgur.com/a/1BH3cgL](https://imgur.com/a/1BH3cgL) 

Battery Usage:

I am using a Pixel 3XL for this test. I listened to two broadway soundtracks (Hamilton and 10 minutes of Greatest Showmen) for the whole 2.5 hours and made note of what the battery level was at each 5-minute increment. I had I am a business analyst by trade and this data was really cool to look at. It is clear that the buds do in fact switch master-slave as can be seen at around minute 70. I ran into some issues that could be affecting the battery life, and the master-slave switching (see below).

Battery Life Estimation:

I used two models for this I found the minute number where the battery average equaled 50% (top graph), which occurred at minute number 110. Extrapolating that out, I would estimate a 220-minute battery life estimation.

The other model used uses the full 2.5 of data and trends the data to zero, and we take the average of both of these points. So, in this case, we would be looking at around 165 minutes for the Left bud, and 270 minutes for the right bud. Adding these together and dividing by 2 (for having 2 buds) is 225 minutes.

Both of these models are estimating around 222.5 minutes, which is far below the stated 300 minutes.

Bluetooth issues:

I had not had any problems with these buds up until starting this test. I did just get them today, and used them for probably around five hours, though I probably never used them long enough to get them to switch the master-slave because I would always charge them when either bud was around 60%.

You can see the issues that I ran into at minute 105. I lost full Bluetooth connectivity, they did not show up in my Bluetooth list. So I plugged the right bud into the case and popped it back out. This seemed to work and I was connected again, but then the real issues started. 

Looking at the battery drain after the Bluetooth first dropped, it seems that the left bud was once again the master. About one time per minute the right bud would drop all audio and I would only have audio in the left bud, after about 5-10 seconds the left would then drop out as well, and then after about 10 more seconds, they both would come back up.

I believe the buds were trying to switch the master to the right bud but were unable to do so. After 20 minutes of the buds doing this, I once again had the Bluetooth fully drop, and they came back on their own. Looking at the data and the amount of battery percentage drop, it does look like the Right finally was the master.

Conclusion:

Ultimately this isn't something I can live with for a device that is $190. With Google's very short return window, I have opened a ticket with Google to return these buds. It is a shame too, I really like them, but with the really low battery life (less than stated in my experience, I would have been fine with 5 hours), and the Bluetooth drop, they need to be returned. Thanks for sticking with me this long.

It's interesting the consistent discrepancy in battery drain between the buds.  Anecdote and a source from the verge indicated that buds trade off the processing; I'm not sure if this is true, or maybe 1 hour isn't long enough.

What is interesting is that I did this test a second time after recharging back to full and the buds reversed behavior for which one drained faster.

1459,GooglePixel,"This happened on Thursday evening, but I haven't had time to post until now.

I received the Pixel Buds 2 on Thursday morning.  I was actually impressed with the Pixel Buds, 2.  The sound, quality, pairing, and overall fit them are impressive. I wore them all day as I worked, they were more comfortable than the Beast X w/ foam Comply tips I was using previously. 

Inspired by the Post made by u/jjricks I decided to test my Pixel Buds 2 while riding my bike. All in all the ride was about 20 miles, through downtown, then to some neighborhoods and finally to the trails.  

I like to hear the sound of cars while I ride, so I do not ride with my BeatsX . The seal BeatsX create block out too much noise. The Pixel Buds do a much better job of allowing road noise to enter the ear. I felt confident riding as I could still hear road noise. Additionally pausing by touching the earbud is more straightforward than searching for the volume rocker and clicking it. 

Enjoying my ride, I got through downtown impressed with the buds. Unfortunately I encountered some of California's finest potholes. After hitting one a large one, my left Pixel Bud was ejected and immediately ran over. I braked so hard my Garmin alerted my emergency contacts that I was in an accident. I recovered the left earbud, then removed my right and continued my ride.   


Here is the aftermath:

1462,GooglePixel,"First of all, I am not bashing on Google in anyway. I have been super pumped for these and they work flawlessly with my Pixel 3 XL. Secondly, my research is very brief but all of the articles I found said the same thing. So take this information with a grain of salt. I'm mostly doing this as a buyer-beware kind of deal breaker for some folks who invest in new tech, but maybe someone can come up with a fix to this. 

According to the [Homespot Bluetooth audio transmitter adapter product page](http://www.homespotdigital.com/homespot-bluetooth-5-0-audio-transmitter-adapter-with-built-in-digital-mic-for-in-game-voice-chat-usb-c-connector-aptx-low-latency-for-nintendo-switch-lite-for-airpods-ps4-bose-sony-and-bluetooth-headphones/), the headphones you want to connect with the adapter need to support ""Qualcomm’s APTX Low Latency codec"". I have just done some light research into the Pixel Buds 2 and found that they are *not* equipped with APTX. As stated on the product page of the bluetooth adapter, if your headphones are not equipped with APTX this leads to serious lag between what is happening on the screen and what you hear. This is what I experienced and prompted my research. Which is a real shame, I was looking forward to being stylish with my new gadgets. 

This issue could also occur in other bluetooth adapters, but Homespot's adapter is what I'm using. So far I've only tested in Handheld mode, but I can't imagine they'd work differently if the problem lies with the Buds themselves. 

Hope this helps someone who is experiencing the same thing.

1464,GooglePixel,"I listen to a decent amount of bass-heavy music, and a good bit of hardstyle.

The [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds) really blew my expectations out of the water. The bass, to me, sounds really good and it accurately captures the lows. If you're a basshead then pretty much no pair of wireless buds is going to satisfy you; they don't blow your ears out, but the bass is full and heavy.

If you're worried about bass, I would say that you shouldn't be.

Also, if anyone wants a comparison to the wired [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds), I would honestly say that for $30 compared to $180, the wired [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) are EXTREMELY worth it. The wireless [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds) definitely sound better, but the wired ones are nothing to sniff at either and still sound really good in comparison. The wired buds are not as heavy on the bass, though, and the highs aren't quite as good as the wireless buds either.

**EDIT**: I want to be clear, in my opinion the [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds) are good for being wireless earbuds **and** they are good when looked at in a vacuum. You might get better bass in some other buds, but the bass is still very good in the [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds).

The other point being made is that if you want value for your money and **don't need wireless buds** but still want something that sounds great, get the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) or [Apple earbuds](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug), both are $30 each, although I think the audio quality of the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) is much better than Apple's earbuds, but you won't really notice unless you own both.

1472,GooglePixel,"Overall I'm really enjoying my Pixel Buds, my first truly wireless headphones. Fit is good, they are comfortable for many hours of wear, and sounds quality is plenty good for me and I'm getting no hissing sound!

1. Better integration with Chromebooks. I see no reason Chromebooks can't have Android level of integration.
2. Easier device switching. I've actually used them as much with my work MBP and Chromebook as I have my phone. Especially when working I'd love an easier way to switch between the MBP and my phone.
3. Max loudness isn't enough! I used them when mowing my lawn and when playing music they were audible, but I had trouble hearing podcasts.

1478,GooglePixel,"Hi all, 

I had a Pixel 3a last year and the phone was amazing -- the camera, battery, and performance all did a great job on a day to day basis. The only downside is when I would record band practices at a loud volume using the 3a (I tried several recording apps) and it was worst sounding audio I've ever heard (I compared the audio recording to my bandmates' iPhone XR and Pixel 3 recordings, and there's no comparison). The 3a's recording was clipping with tons of distortion -- it sounded like it was recorded on a moto g3 -- a cheap budget phone with a cheap mic and audio chip (I guess the 3a is a cheaper budget phone so there ya go). 

I'm thinking about the getting the 4a, but I'm worried it'll have the same issues, i.e. Google will make the performance and battery better than the 3a, but will still have cheap parts (mic) to keep the price down.

1481,GooglePixel,"I'll start with the case since there isn't much to detail.  

It's exactly as advertised--minimal, seemingly indesctructible and beautifully simple.  I put the lanyard on it, but since it will probably be either in my pocket or purse, I'll probably take it off.  I switch my (cheapo) phone cases like I'm changing clothes, and I know quality when I see it.  I have no doubt the case will last far longer than the buds.

Now for the Buds.  

I forgot about the 'buzz' that everyone is talking about which meant I also didn't hear it.  They have only been used during a dog walk and about 45 minutes in the house doing chores. There is always something going on around here so maybe it wasn't quiet enough, but since I'm almost never in a 100% silent situation, I'll either call myself lucky or such a non-audiophile that it just didn't bother me.

I can only speak to the battery life in that the buds didn't die during the use I gave it which was typical for me.  I do both ears while walking, and one while around/in the house.

I found out that I have weird ears.  One took the large tip, the other the small, but the buds were very comfortable.  I usually use Comply foam tips so I was pleasantly surprised.  I may write Comply to see if they will offer tips for these, but won't be bothered if they don't.  The sound for my audiobook was clear and crisp--I could hear the narrator take a breath hear and there--the sound quality was equal to my beloved Melomania 1 buds.

Okay, now the good stuff. Google Freaking Assistant is just fucking amazing.  I was looking for a tweak or two over what it does now, but man!  While on my walk I got a notification on my phone which I normally ignore.  The buds helpfully suggested that if I wanted to listen to it, to hit the bud til i heard a chime and let go.  It gave me another short instruction when it started that I was too jazzed to pay attention to, but it read me my entire freaking email, the text from my daughter AND the title of the LA Times article I was just sent.  So damn cool.

1516,GooglePixel,"I'm incredibly disappointed in these. I had very high expectations, but these aren't even mediocre--they're unusable. 

The most serious issue is simply that when I take them out of the case, while they immediately pair with the phone (Pixel 4XL), there's no sound. The media is playing, and the buds chirp in my ear to show they're connected, but they don't play the audio from the phone. It works fine if I reboot the phone, but that's not exactly convenient.

The audio quality on phone calls is the next most annoying problem. It's perfectly clear, but the volume--even turned up to max--is so low that it's inaudible outdoors.

And finally, they just drop the connection constantly. Every few minutes one bud or the other drops the audio then picks it back up, and a couple of times they've just flat disconnected from the phone.

These are the worst wireless buds I've ever used. Considering returning them to Google, but honestly, I'm not sure if I want new ones given that I've seen similar complaints from other users. I don't really want to do the dance of returning flawed product for similarly flawed reconditioned product.

I need to change my phone (Nokia 7+) and I hesitate to get the 3a currently on sale in my country ( 299€ ) or to wait for the 4a which will certainly be 399€

Has anyone encountered the issues i've recently been having with my phone's tendency to randomly drop  my home wifi and mobile data networks. 

With the wifi, after about an hour of connection to my network, it will drop and the icon will show no wifi networks available.

The only solution is to reboot the phone, which solves the issue temporarily. I've tried rebooting the home network and it hadn't improved matters.

1520,GooglePixel,"I love my Pixel 3a but I've had the OIS (optical image stabilization) for the rear camera die on me twice in 1 year. I think I found an issue with Google Messages that could be causing the problem. Here's the steps to replicate the problem:

1) When messaging a contact, go into add photo mode. The camera will activate and OIS (when bad) will vibrate the phone.

2)Press the back button so you are now in regular text mode. OIS will turn off (since the camera is off).

3)Turn off the screen, then unlock the phone. You'll be back in messages, in text mode, BUT the OIS will be activated. So if the OIS isn't bad, you wouldn't notice. It would just feel as normal, but it's there and it's on, using up its life cycle.


So the ENTIRE time your texting that contact the OIS is being used even though you are only in text mode. If you text one main contact throughout the day (significant other, colleague, etc.) then this could add hours of use to the OIS daily. I doubt it's rated for that much use.

1525,GooglePixel,"So I just picked up the pixel buds 2 and have been highly anticipating them throughout the spring. I've never had ""nice"" Bluetooth earbuds, just a couple pairs of the cheap ones on Amazon. I do, however, heavily use and love my Sony ~~XM3s~~ WH1000XM3's for music, phone calls and PS4. I picked up the pixel buds looking for that seamless integration with my Pixel 4XL. So after my first work-from-home day, here are my impressions.

I got what I wanted, seamless integration with the pixel 4XL. Setup was quick and easy. The buds pair almost instantly when you open the case. You get a nice overview of battery level for each individual earbud and for the case itself in the settings menu.

Speaking of battery, I've found that the earbud battery life is about accurate to what Google says. At 5hrs of music playback and 3 hrs of talk time, it doesn't compete with other earbuds in the price range.

However, this hasn't been an issue for me so far because when I've been on phone calls today, I've just been using one earbud at a time. I absolutely love this feature and it seems to work very well. Want to use just one earbud? Take one out of the case and stick it in your ear. The phone recognizes which one you're using and which one is charging in the case. I took my first hour-long call this morning with the left earbud and drained it down to 66% battery, then swapped for the second consecutive hour call in matter of like 3 sec. I think I'll be doing this for most of my use cases, even when traveling, but if you're someone that needs both earbuds for long phone call sessions (over 3 hrs at a time) I wouldn't recommend these.

Sound is much different than my Sony's but I love it. You can easily hear the outside world, and there is crisp, clear music kind of just happening in your ears. It's much different than the ANC XM3s. You're kind of in your own isolated world with those headphones - it sounds that way and certainly feels that way as well. I imagine I'll be using the Sony's and pixel buds in different scenarios from now on. If I'm just listening to music at my desk, or on a plane, I'll be using the Sony's. If I'm exercising, taking calls, or working in the lab while on a call, I'll be using the pixels. In fact I think I'll be taking most of my calls with the pixel buds from now on.

Comfort: for my ears, these are very comfortable. They don't form a seal like other earbuds, but the little rubber spine fits perfectly- I don't think I could shake them out if I tried. I do have a cheap pair of ~~Aukey~~ Taotronics Airpod knock offs, and when I'm on a call with those, I purposely have to loosen them from my ear a bit, because it's hard to talk with a perfect seal on your ear. Anyways, the pixel buds are pretty comfortable for me for the first hour or two of wearing. After that, I felt like I wanted to take them out and let my ears breathe. 

However, my wife tried them and they absolutely do not work for her ears. The little rubber spine just does not have a place to rest for her ears. That being said, she knows she has weird ears and has a lot of trouble finding earbuds that work for her in general. She primarily uses the Bose 700's.

Later in the afternoon, I gave a test call to my wife from the car, and results were great. Used the Google assistant via the headphones to place the call, and that worked immediately, just like using it from my phone. At first I had just the right earbud in, and my wife said the audio was clear and she couldn't hear any of the background noise from inside the car. She couldn't tell I was actually calling from the car. I popped the other earbud in, and she said the audio got a bit louder, but still just as clear. Then I rolled down the windows expecting the mics to pick up the wind whipping around in the car, but nothing. Seems like whatever tricks Google came up with to cut out background noise really works, and call quality is great.

Overall, I'm loving the new pixel buds. I've seen some reviews mention that they're a bit overpriced, especially compared to the Samsung buds. I haven't tried those so I'm not in a position to compare value, but I will say that I don't feel like I paid too much. I'm very happy with the features, build quality and sound quality, enough so to write up a review on them.

TL;DR. Good sound, good comfort, great call quality, great build quality, great features, seamless integration with my Pixel, meh battery life. I'm a happy customer on the whole.

Edit: I actually have the Taotronics (not Aukey) Airpods knock-offs. Did a little layman's sound comparison with them, my WH1000XM3s and the Buds2 in one of the comments below.

Edit2: I have the over-the-ear WH1000XM3's, not the WF1000XM3 buds.

Hi everyone,

Okay so I dropped my Pixel 3a in the toilet (thankfully it was unused). I dried it off immediately and put it in rice to dry out for a few days (i know the rice probably wasnt a great idea). When i turned it on, the screen started acting strange like apps randomly opening and things were getting clicked on without me doing anything. After a few days though this stopped happening and just some parts of the screen were unresponsive. That was 6 months ago and i have been getting by using it with the unresponsive parts of the screen because i couldnt afford to repair it and i was overseas when this happened.

I was just wondering if it is at all repairable now or if i should look into getting a new phone. The phone is working fine now, the unresponsive areas are the only issue, but not sure if theres any hidden damage.

A few days ago, my 5 month old Pixel 4 lost all signal. No bars, no data. I rebooted it a couple times hoping to get it back online, but to no avail. So, I used it offline for about 20 minutes before it abruptly shut off. No logo or warning or anything. This was a first. I plugged it into the charger and tried holding down all the different button combinations, but nada. I'm wondering if it's bricked.

The battery was still half full when it shut off. Also, the phone was somewhat warm due to the hot Texas weather that day, but I wasn't putting it through anything demanding. To add to this, I have pretty much all of the non essential (polite way of saying 'pointless') settings/features turned off at all times, ie: motion sensors, assistant, smooth display, etc. I also keep it on airplane mode most of the time. I did have developer options turned on but only so I could force dark mode. Never messed around in there otherwise.

It's weird to me that the cellular service went out before it shut off. I haven't been able to come across any other instance of this. The phone is still being paid and doesn't have any external damage or viruses that I know of. Anyways, appreciated will be much help

1543,GooglePixel,"So first of all, I've never owned a pair of $100+ wireless earbuds in the past. I own a Pixel 3XL and have been holding out for these buds. Bought them right away when they dropped.

Got them in the mail yesterday and I absolutely love them. I've always had issues with earbuds in general. They all either hurt after 20 minutes, fall out, or both. That is until I tried the included wired earbuds that came with my Pixel phone. The sound quality was mediocre (To be expected) but I noticed the buds actually fit, stayed in, and didn't hurt.

Fast forward to yesterday. I pop the Pixel Buds in and love them immediately. The sound is great, the fit is super secure. (Which never happens for me). Even while walking today and I had it paused, after an hour or two with the buds in, I still had to physically reach for my ear to check if it was still in. They feel almost non-existent, and that to me, is astounding.

Now to the issue... And from my research, it seems this may just be the case with any Bluetooth wireless earbuds. Occasionally while I'd be walking, with my phone in my pocket or backpack, if I turn my head, or reach toward my face, one or both buds would stutter and temporarily lose Bluetooth connection (only for a split second at a time), but still, that seems a little disconcerting. Maybe I need a better place to keep my phone on my walks, or just try to avoid turning my head or reaching towards my face. If anyone has a suggestion, I'd really appreciate it. The only other Bluetooth device I had connected at the time was a Fitbit. 

That being said, I absolutely love everything else. During my 2 and a half hour walk, I listed to podcasts, music, and even had a phone call, wearing a face mask, while walking, and the recipient thought the call quality was good. Couldn't be happier with my purchase, just wish I could figure out how to avoid the Bluetooth stuttering.

TL;DR:

The Good: Buds fit perfectly in my ears that have issues with almost every other bud I've tried. Sound is great, easy to use, super secure in my ear, even over a long walk. 

Slight Issue:Experienced a lot of Bluetooth stuttering while turning my head or putting hands near face. But not sure if this is normal or not",Pixel Buds First Opinions (And 1 Issue),0,so first of all i ve never own a pair of wireless earbud in the past i own a pixel xl and have been hold out for these bud bought them right away when they drop got them in the mail yesterday and i absolut love them i ve alway had issu with earbud in gener they all either hurt after minut fall out or both that is until i tri the includ wire earbud that came with my pixel phone the sound qualiti wa mediocr to be expect but i notic the bud actual fit stay in and didn t hurt fast forward to yesterday i pop the pixel bud in and love them immedi the sound is great the fit is super secur which never happen for me even while walk today and i had it paus after an hour or two with the bud in i still had to physic reach for my ear to check if it wa still in they feel almost non exist and that to me is astound now to the issu and from my research it seem thi may just be the case with ani bluetooth wireless earbud occasion while i d be walk with my phone in my pocket or backpack if i turn my head or reach toward my face one or both bud would stutter and temporarili lose bluetooth connect onli for a split second at a time but still that seem a littl disconcert mayb i need a better place to keep my phone on my walk or just tri to avoid turn my head or reach toward my face if anyon ha a suggest i d realli appreci it the onli other bluetooth devic i had connect at the time wa a fitbit that be said i absolut love everyth els dure my and a half hour walk i list to podcast music and even had a phone call wear a face mask while walk and the recipi thought the call qualiti wa good couldn t be happier with my purchas just wish i could figur out how to avoid the bluetooth stutter tl dr the good bud fit perfectli in my ear that have issu with almost everi other bud i ve tri sound is great easi to use super secur in my ear even over a long walk slight issu experienc a lot of bluetooth stutter while turn my head or put hand near face but not sure if thi is normal or not
1544,GooglePixel,"Not sure if I just got an especially defective unit but my experience with these have been incredibly disappointing, verging on the edge of madness and anger. The problems I face so far:

1. Left ear cuts out way too frequently. I would have been willing to look past this if it happened once every 20 minutes or so, but so far it has been really inconsistent. If I'm holding my phone up and watching a video it's fine, but if I lay down in bed the left ear cuts out every 10 seconds. In a regular seated position, I get cut outs every half minute just by resting my phone on my lap. When using my friends $30 wireless earbuds from Amazon I get zero cutouts in literally any position I am in.

2. The buzzing is LOUD and AWFUL. I have more sensitive-than-normal ears (got tested by an audiologist one time for issues awhile back) and while I may not notice it that much while out and about, if I'm alone in my bedroom watching something or listening to music it's super loud to me, even more so when there's silent parts in the thing I'm listening to. A lot of audio devices I have used do have an extremely light, barely noticeable buzz to them, probably made audible by my sensitive hearing, but the pixel buds are probably the worst I have heard in a long time, and akin to dollar store earbuds.

3. Battery drain is strange. The right ear bud drains considerably faster than the left. Although I haven't timed it for the full reported five hours, I did run it from 100% to 0%. As my right ear drained to zero, my left ear was still at 50%. I heard this may be due to some sort of master/slave relationship but the discrepancy is way too massive to have any real benefit. I would've been fine with maybe a 10-15% difference in battery but a whole 50%? What's going on here?

4. The mic only works when it wants to. Haven't heard anyone talking about this, but I 'stress tested' the Google assistant asking all kinds of things. Half the time the buds either got it wrong or just didn't hear me say anything at all. I get far far better results just using my phone, and if my buds are always connected to my phone I see no use in using the buds for Google assistant anyway.

I'm going to RMA this unit I got but overall my interest in Google products has kinda soured with this latest generation of products. I've been a google fanboy ever since the Nexus S came out and have near consistently upgraded my phone with Google line products ever since. The Nexus line phones were damn near amazing and when Pixel series came out it blew me out of the water every time until the 4XL. Preordered it and had nothing but problems with it since (3-4hrs SOT even after clean reset, hiccups and slow down, wonky cell reception with the same sim that worked perfect on the pixel 2, the back plate for some reason is literally peeling off the back of my phone).

The fact these are problems I even have to face at this price point is an absolute disgrace. I thought I was paying for simplicity, high quality QC, and for it to 'just work', but so far it just hasn't been like that the past year. I used to trash Samsung products for its overbloated software and flashy design, and apple is just apple, but as this point I feel like I may start considering the switch.",The new pixel buds are absolutely awful.

1545,GooglePixel,"When asking my assistant ""what song is this"" I would USUALLY receive the bars, indicating it's listening, and then a response.

I think I read on here that someone else was having this issue as well. Maybe one bud is acting as the master and thus using more power?

1569,GooglePixel,"(Apologies in advance for another one of these ""I got my pixel buds"" posts)

So I got mine yesterday and one of the first things I noticed was that at max volume (maxed out on my phone) they seemed fairly quiet. After a few minutes of being a bit disappointed, I found that apparently the volume control of the buds themselves seems to be independent of the volume on my phone. I used the touch gesture on the earbuds and they got a fair bit louder. The same worked in reverse; buds volume maxed, phone volume was lowered briefly and the buds were still maxed out when I used the touch gesture.

1570,GooglePixel,"About 12 days ago I noticed my Pixel XL was frequently disconnecting from and immediately reconnecting to WiFi at home. (Due to shelter in place I haven't been able to test it outside my home.) My broadband modem was an oldish Pace (about 5 years old) and we were thinking it was the culprit. We hooked up a very old (like 9 year old) Netgear to the Pace and switched the phone to connect to the Netgear's WiFi. Worked like a champ, so we had our ISP swap out the Pace for a new modem; they gave us an Arris BGW210. 

I switched the Pixel to the Arris's WiFi and was pretty dismayed to see the same frequent disconnection start happening again. 

I've reset Wifi/mobile/Bluetooth, restarted the phone, and am currently fiddling with various settings to change from googling this issue (all of which I did before but now there's a new modem, so.)  Things I have not done (and am reluctant to) are a factory reset, and upgrading to 10 (it had auto upgraded last year and the performance was so terrible I downgraded back to 9.)

1571,GooglePixel,"Okay friends.  My Google Assistant has stopped talking to me when I ask questions.

When I access the Assistant either by saying ""Okay Google, squeezing the sides, or tapping the App, the Assistant wakes up (colored bars moving), and displays the Assistant's response (such as, ""This is what I found."") and the answer/information to my question.  But, NO verbal Assistant.

Volumes are Up.  

If I go into Google &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Google Assistant &gt; Assistant &gt; Assistant Voice , the Assistant will talk audibly in all of the 10 or 12 different voices.

But, when I go back and access the Assistant, as I stated above, the Assistant will do what I ask, but it doesn't verbalize the responses.

I have checked everything I can think of for the past week, to no avail.  This is driving me nuts.

Thanks for any help/assistance.  (No pun intended.)

EDIT :  Further Updates  --

Went into Safe Mode, again.  I then tapped the Assistant icon on the Google Search bar.  The first two times, the Assistant did what I asked, but Did Not Verbalize.  The third (and fourth, fifth, and sixth) time, it finally responded Verbally.

Rebooted and tapped the icon.  Assistant did what I asked, but NO Verbal response.  This woman is killing me.  And, I cannot find an app that I uploaded recently that would have affected the Assistant Voice.

It gets weirder.  A bit later, I was doing a Search in Google manually.  (Tap the Search bar and get the screen with the keyboard and the search suggestions as you type.)  Slow me, I had forgotten about the microphone icon at the top of the page.  I tapped the icon, the Assistant beeped, I asked a question, and the Assistant displayed my answer on-screen and (wtf) answered VERBALLY. 

However, it didn't answer in the British Female voice that I have set, but in the default American Female voice, of course.

Tried accessing the Assistant, again, by the usual methods (icon on Home screen Search bar, squeezing the sides, or tapping the Assistant App icon).  And, of course, wouldn't you know, the Assistant displays answers on-screen, but NO Verbal response.

1575,GooglePixel,"Received my new buds yesterday - love the feel and integration with my phone. However, my Teams meeting this morning did not go great. I should mention I am using the Teams desktop app on a Lenovo ThinkPad.

If you use Hands-Free AG (buds for both speaker and mic audio), the connection will drop and the audio will be crap. The audio quality is not unique to the buds though - it is due to the bandwidth of Bluetooth. However, I have never encountered the full connection drop with other devices before.

Everything is good if you set speaker audio to the buds and mic audio to the computer.

If you hover over the speaker icon in the Windows toolbar - it will display a bogus battery percentage (19% when buds were at over 90%) and possibly set the mode back to Hands-Free AG. At that point, my connection dropped again. So that is definitely not good.

One of the reasons I love the Pixel is the news screen.  I am a news junkie and being able to just swipe right on my hope screen is so convenient.  Google recently did something to the news screen to both shorten it and remove the option to load more articles.  Also, if you click on an article and then use the back gesture it kicks me to my last google search.  It used to take me back to my news screen.  Also, the share option in Instagram used to populate with the people you've shared with most recently.  Now, it's blank and I have to search for the person every time I want to share something.  Finally, asking google home to add something to my shoping list used to be incredibly accurate.  Not so much lately.  Frequently, when telling google to add something to my shopping list, the item will show up with ""to shopping list"" after it.  All of these are, I admit, minor annoyances.  But whyyyyyyyyyy?

1578,GooglePixel,"Last night I noticed a slight image distortion in the top-left of the screen on my 3a, and looked closely to find a tiny bump under the glass.  Within a couple of hours, the single bump turned into a path of multiple bumps, with a crease going down the center of the path.  This was while sitting at home: no travels, no moisture, no bumps, no bruises.  I did my best at taking a couple of pictures [here](https://i.imgur.com/Cb86B7m.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/I3yb5D8.jpg), but they don't do it justice.  The glass is perfectly smooth, and even though the photos make it look like the bumps are floating above the AMOLED panel, in real life they look like they're pushing up from the underside of the panel.  And, photographing the slight crease effect is beyond me; I couldn't get it captured no matter what I tried.

I'm still under warranty, but I've been burnt by Google customer support in the past, and the uBreakiFix locations in my area don't have the most inspiring reviews.

1579,GooglePixel,"Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*

Before you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:

###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.
Although some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings &gt; System &gt; Advanced &gt; System update &gt; Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.

###Check for power-hungry apps.
Despite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.

* Make sure that the ""Apps consuming battery"" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; notifications &gt; See all ___ apps &gt; More options (the triple dot) &gt; Show system &gt; Android system &gt; Notifications &gt; Other)
* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; More options (the triple dot) &gt; Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).
* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings &gt; Apps &amp; notifications &gt; Advanced &gt; Special app access &gt; Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Adaptive Battery).
* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings &gt; search for *appName* &amp; select *appName*)
* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing &amp; holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.

###Investigate battery intensive features.
Some functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:

* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.
* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings &gt; Security and Location &gt; Location &gt; Advanced &gt; Battery saving &gt; Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.
* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.

###Contact Google Support.
Google's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings &gt; Tips &amp; Support, or just ask your Google Assistant ""troubleshoot my battery"".

###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.
Sometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings &gt; Google &gt; Backup &gt; Back up now **and check** Google Photos &gt; sidebar (the three lines) &gt; Settings &gt; Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)

1603,GooglePixel,"Finished a 1.5 hour cycling loop and have a few thoughts on the Pixel Buds, this is coming from a strong advocate of headphone jacks:

(originally meant as a reply to u/thoriumdioxide but I figured others might want to see this)

(I also was using a Galaxy Watch Active 2 to keep track of the workout, so essentially had 3 bluetooth devices connected...? Or is the master/slave connection still a thing but it's cleverly worked-around?)

Pros:

* These are my first wireless audio device of any kind and I will say, getting rid of the wire is nice, especially for exercise.
* They have almost no weight to them compared to my usual over-ear headphones, it's easy to forget you're wearing them and they're incredibly comfortable.
* Google Assistant and touch controls is fantastic! I know everyone else bought headphones that can do this years ago, but being able to shuffle an album, turn up the volume, play/pause, or text somebody without stopping to look at my phone is life changing. It can also pick up my ""Hey Google!"" easily, even when the wind is rushing past.
* I can wear a helmet again instead of my headphones (safety bonus!)
* They sound great! Not an audiophile, but I think these are incredible for such a tiny package!

Cons:

* On my hour-and-a-half-ish cycling trip there were unfortunately a lot of little hiccups. I'm not sure how much of it was caused by external interference or complete incompetence on my part, (likely the latter) but I'll break it down:
   * Although you can listen on either bud, I still feel like there's possibly a master/slave connection going on here, with the right and left buds respectively. If I cup a hand over the right bud, the left one stops working. If I cup a hand over the left bud, the left bud... also stops working. Maybe I'm misinterpreting this, can't be sure. It starts up again immediately when the hand is removed. I first noticed this when going to pause the music and the signal dropped out. (Still have this problem even when only my finger is touching it. Could this have to do with wearing a helmet? Not as easily reproducible just sitting here at my desk. I thought they advertised I could walk x number of feet away from my phone and they would still work. If they're cutting out at 2 to 3 feet I don't know what to think)
   * Quite a few times during the trip the connection seemed to cut out briefly, just randomly; always the left bud, and always slightly jarring.
   * I might've been imagining it, but I think for a few minutes during the latter-half of the workout, the left bud slightly was louder than the right one, throwing me off balance a bit. It's all cleared up now, however.
   * Interestingly enough at one point they completely quit working altogether, but I'm not convinced it was entirely their fault. I was about 7 miles north of home and both buds suddenly cut out, making the disconnection chime. I struggled to connect them for about 10 minutes (clear pairing, rebooting phone, etc.) then eventually gave up and resorted to cycling home in silence. However relocating by 100 yards seemed to do the trick, and they continued functioning afterwards. First guess is that I wandered into some sort of unknown 2.4GHz bluetooth-jamming-mega-dead-zone, but my Galaxy Watch was connected just fine the whole time, so I can't say. Maybe I'll go back to that spot and see if they disconnect again.
* The Assistant can't tell me what the battery level of the buds is, instead vocally redirecting me to the app. A minor thing though, for sure, but annoying while on a bike
* Not sure how much they can do about this since hardware limitations are a thing (and the fact that something this small sounds this good, and even exists in the first place is a a miracle of engineering in my outsider's opinion), but a slight buzzing is definitely noticeable in the background of quieter audio. Full disclosure I'm a hobbyist-pianist 'blursed' with perfect pitch, and known by family members to have extremely sensitive hearing (but terrible red green color-blindness, if that makes up for anything) Doesn't bother me much, but it's there
* After wearing over-ear headphones for so long I forgot that wind-noise is something you hear while cycling, but there's nothing actionable about that so...  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Overall though, it's been a positive experience and I don't regret getting them. I'm sure the software experience and stability will improve over time; maybe that's why they waited so long to launch. When all is said and done I'm still glad that the headphone jack is an option for at-home listening on my Pixel 3a, and I still resent... ""a certain company"" for making dropping the headphone jack into an industry trend, especially when bluetooth has demonstrated to me tonight that it's not ready for prime-time.

Would recommend!

TL;DR They're pretty great, a bit glitchy at times, but definitely worth it in my opinion

1610,GooglePixel,"hey. i have a Pixel 4 and i love it despite some flaws, but there is one thing that bugs me most about it. the fact that Google doesn't force their app developers to follow new Android rules (for a lack of a better term) such as the notification gesture bar. 

**here's some examples:**

[example 1](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4yn7UXfYb1vopbfm6)

if you don't understand, some apps do stretch out all the way to the bottom of the screen, but many apps do not. this leaves an ugly black bar where the gesture bar would be. there is nothing more annoying than having a phone with a nearly full screen display have and ugly black intrusion *(not to mention that the 4's very curved corners make it much worse than on a Pixel 2 or so)*

**more annoyingly, some apps can't decide if they stretch to the bottom or not:**

[example 2](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wUr2i8FJTcNjkBBi8)

this probably even more an annoyance because it shows that 1. app developers don't really care whether their apps work properly or not and 2. Google hasn't built even a minor (but a welcome aesthetic change) to their OS.

i know this sound like the most first world of issues, but Apple forced their developers to do this with the X series of devices, but Google with a lot more clout and power, doesn't care if app devs work with their OS or not.

will we see any changes in Android 11 that will start stretching apps to negate the need for the black bar?",my biggest pet peeve with Pixel (and maybe Android in general),0,hey i have a pixel and i love it despit some flaw but there is one thing that bug me most about it the fact that googl doesn t forc their app develop to follow new android rule for a lack of a better term such as the notif gestur bar here s some exampl exampl http photo app goo gl yn uxfyb vopbfm if you don t understand some app do stretch out all the way to the bottom of the screen but mani app do not thi leav an ugli black bar where the gestur bar would be there is noth more annoy than have a phone with a nearli full screen display have and ugli black intrus not to mention that the s veri curv corner make it much wors than on a pixel or so more annoyingli some app can t decid if they stretch to the bottom or not exampl http photo app goo gl wur i fjtcnjkbbi thi probabl even more an annoy becaus it show that app develop don t realli care whether their app work properli or not and googl hasn t built even a minor but a welcom aesthet chang to their os i know thi sound like the most first world of issu but appl forc their develop to do thi with the x seri of devic but googl with a lot more clout and power doesn t care if app dev work with their os or not will we see ani chang in android that will start stretch app to negat the need for the black bar
1611,GooglePixel,"I finally decided to get a battery replacement for my Pixel 2.  Took it to a ubreakifix store.  The guy gave me the spiel about how sometimes the screen breaks or whatever during a replacement and asked if that happens would I want to pay for a replacement or get a new phone (I opted for the replacement).  He optimistically said his new guy is ""8 for 10"", which gave me some pause, but decided to go ahead with the replacement. 

Was able to pickup the phone in about 3 hours.  Thankfully they didn't have an issue with the screen.  So far the battery is working much much better than the original battery.  

However, many hours later when I went to play some audio as I went to bed I realized the sound quality was different.  Things sound slightly muffled.  Not greatly, but the audio definitely isn't as crisp.  I have another Pixel 2 I use as a backup so I've been able to play the same audio side-by-side to confirm it's not in my head. 

What did they mess up when doing the battery replacement?  Is it worth complaining to them or will they likely just make everything worse if I ask for a repair (assuming I can convince them it's their fault)?  Is this a common speaker problem when doing the replacement?  I've read of various problems, but one about not a slightly muffling of the sound.  Is it a problem that could easily get worse?

It also feels like favoritism.

Eventually 90% of the volume returned and that's how it has stayed, the quality has dropped drastically tho, anything with slight bass or anything on fill volume sound s very very low quality.
