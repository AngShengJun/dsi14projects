So I restart the phone hoping that maybe it's just bugging out. This turns out to be a terrible idea because now my phone is set to Do Not Disturb. So I no longer have the only way I was able to get into my phone. I can't use the google assistant either. My phone is completely unresponsive except for the ""Talk Back"" feature.

What do I do? I've tried literally everything I can think of and nothing is working. Has anything like this happened to anyone?

is pixel 4a gonna be better in these ways:

from most important to least

**price:** &lt;$280

1. **comparable or better display than galaxy a51**: what are the main sites that tests the display quality of phones (brightness, color, everything else about displays, etc.)? so we can compare. has to, at the bare minimal, have similar resolution + screen size, or better
2. **better or comparable gps antenna than galaxy a51:** how does the gps antenna compare to other ones? any tests / analysis? what company made the gps antenna?
3. **phone options:** what newer or old phones have comparable resolution and dispaly size? and costs less than $280, and is better?
4. **good sites to find better phones:** what site could we look at once a year or once every 6 months to see that those new phones are better?
5. **cpu where you dont notice anything slow:** is performance noticeably slow under minimal settings for regular stuff on a weekly basis like using google maps? (say you turn off phone animations and other nonsense)
6. **consistent reliable os updates (guess iphone se + pixel is best at this part):** does having os update matter? if so why exactly?
7. **energy:** battery doesnt matter yea? cos that's what powerbanks are for?
8. **ui:** has anyone used all of the main android modified uis recently (within last 3-6 months) and able to compare them?
9. anything else helpful or insightful to know?
