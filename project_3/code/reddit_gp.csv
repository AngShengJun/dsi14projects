,GooglePixel,"Good Morning 

This morning I attempted to unlock my Google Pixel 4XL, but something strange was going on. The ""Talk Back"" feature was going off, constantly reading what was on the home screen after each time I touched the phone. I could not get my phone to swipe up. It just keeps reading. So I double tap on a notification and it gives me my pin code option. I have to tap a number 4 times just get it to recognize the number. Once I get into my phone ""Talk Back"" starts reading EVERYTHING. I can't swipe any direction or open any apps. Not even the one I clicked on the notification for. Weird. So I restart the phone hoping that maybe it's just bugging out. This turns out to be a terrible idea because now my phone is set to Do Not Disturb. So I no longer have the only way I was able to get into my phone. I can't use the google assistant either. My phone is completely unresponsive except for the ""Talk Back"" feature.

What do I do? I've tried literally everything I can think of and nothing is working. Has anything like this happened to anyone?

is pixel 4a gonna be better in these ways:

from most important to least

**price:** &lt;$280

1. **comparable or better display than galaxy a51**: what are the main sites that tests the display quality of phones (brightness, color, everything else about displays, etc.)? so we can compare. has to, at the bare minimal, have similar resolution + screen size, or better
2. **better or comparable gps antenna than galaxy a51:** how does the gps antenna compare to other ones? any tests / analysis? what company made the gps antenna?
3. **phone options:** what newer or old phones have comparable resolution and dispaly size? and costs less than $280, and is better?
4. **good sites to find better phones:** what site could we look at once a year or once every 6 months to see that those new phones are better?
5. **cpu where you dont notice anything slow:** is performance noticeably slow under minimal settings for regular stuff on a weekly basis like using google maps? (say you turn off phone animations and other nonsense)
6. **consistent reliable os updates (guess iphone se + pixel is best at this part):** does having os update matter? if so why exactly?
7. **energy:** battery doesnt matter yea? cos that's what powerbanks are for?
8. **ui:** has anyone used all of the main android modified uis recently (within last 3-6 months) and able to compare them?
9. anything else helpful or insightful to know?

,GooglePixel,"I posted about a week ago about my Pixel 3a's alarms not going off with the stock clock app, and it seems the issue is deeper.

My notification sounds AND alarm sounds don't work anymore. No DnD, no vibrate, nothing. 

When I go into the ""Sounds"" menu and slide the sliders, only the Media and Call sliders produce anything. Ring and Alarm are silent.

When I click ""phone ringtone,"" none of them make a sound. Same with ""Default Notification Sound"" and ""Default Alarm Sound."" 

Dial Pad, Screen Lock, Charging Sounds, all of them still work. But alarms and notifications are totally muted.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got my new PIxel 4 XL the other day and noticed that it has a green tint when the brightness is below 50% with a gray background when in a dark room. During the day it's not noticeable. Does anyone have this problem? I looked it up and some people have said that it went away after certain updates and it sounds like it's a software issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Google is offering to replace my device, but I want to know if anyone had this problem before and if it's worth the hassle.

,GooglePixel,"Sorry for the length of this post. I ordered the pixel buds on release day and unfortunately was one of those with bluetooth connection issues while on the go (out for a walk or run or with phone in pocket or arm sleeve). I was the first to post about changing the bluetooth avrcp from 1.4 to 1.6, which improved the connection somewhat but not enough. Google sent me a replacement pair which suffers from the same issues. I’m wondering if perhaps this is an issue with the Pixel Buds and Pixel 3 phones (I feel like several others who have posted with issues also have the Pixel 3).

**Issues:**

If I am at home with my phone resting on a table, the connection is fine (with the occasional quick cutout). I am able to walk somewhat freely around my apartment.

As soon as I go to leave, there is extremely bluetooth stuttering, generally with one bud staying connected and the other cutting in and out. This was extreme when the phone is in my pocket, but still would happen with the phone in my hand or in an arm holder. With the first pair of pixel buds, it was the left bud that generally cut in and out, but with the 2nd replacement pair, it alternates. Also on the first pair, the left bud would occasionally be a fraction of a second behind, causing an echo. I haven't seen this yet on my 2nd pair.

I noticed that after 1-2 minutes of this, the connection generally would stabilize. However after 20-25 min, the connection would start to stutter again, and at this point one of the buds will just completely disconnect (the button not work or anything). This happened to me on both the first pair and 2nd pair of Pixel buds. Both times I took the buds out of my ears, put them back in the case, and then retried them. Neither time did this help. Not sure if my sweat caused this, but when I tried the buds an hour or so later, they worked fine.

**Steps Attempted**

Google CSR Sent the following steps. I attempted them multiple times on both sets.

* Make sure the Pixel Buds firmware version and Play Services are both up to date
* Uninstall and update the Google App from Play Store
* Restart the phone
* Reset the Pixel Buds then proceed to pairing and test

In addition, I did a factory reset on my Pixel 3 to see if that would help (and y’all know how annoying that is to do). I did not. Changing the bluetooth avrcp to 1.6 helped somewhat but not really. I don’t really know what the other settings in developer mode does.

Google sent me a replacement pair, hoping that it would fix it. They have not worked.

Maybe it’s an issue with my particular phone? My friend has a Pixel 3 phone. We connect the buds to his phone to see if he had issues, and he had the same connection issues as I have, which leads me to believe that it’s not just my phone and it’s a general issue with the Pixel 3. 

I replicated the same walking/running/biking conditions with other bluetooth headsets I have and none of them had any issues with bluetooth stuttering, connection dropping, or echo. These include:  


* WH-1000XM3 (best headphones ever)
* Anker Soundbuds Curve Wireless Headphones
* Xiaomi Redmi Airdots ($20)
* Uproar Wireless Bluetooth Headphones

Overall I have been really disappointed with the Pixel Buds. Honestly, they don’t seem to work better than the $20 Redmi Airdots.

,GooglePixel,"Hello Everyone,

I recently bought a Google Pixel 3a and I honestly love the phone. The one thing that is bothering me though... I am constantly losing connection when it comes to phone calls, and will have a call drop at least once during a conversation. 

I have noticed that my signal is usually 1 or 2 bars while at home (even though my old phone and my family's signal is at 3 to 4 in the same location), and that the phone relies exclusively on WiFi calling. In addition, whenever a call is dropped, I have to either restart my phone or wait a bit before calling back because the call won't go through (I assume until connection is restablished). 

I am by no means tech savvy, but I have had the SIM card switched, taken to T-Mobile to have it looked at, and was told to keep Mobile Data on at all times to ""resolve the issue"", but nothing seems to be working. :/ 

Has anyone experienced this before? I am about to ask T-Mobile to take the phone back because I cannot work with this kind of bug.

,GooglePixel,"I have a Pixel 2, now running the May 2020 security update. A few weeks ago, I started having issues with the pattern unlock- it suddenly stopped accepting the pattern I know to be correct. It doesn't ""lock out"", as in, I can try repeatedly, seemingly infinitely. But even after entering the same (correct) pattern 50 times it may still not unlock. Fingerprint sensor works, but sometimes it says the pattern is required for extra security, and of course the same goes for after a reboot. 

About 2 weeks ago I was totally locked out. I ultimately had no choice but to factory reset via recovery mode. Interestingly, upon restoring my apps/data from my Google backup, it asked for my pattern to confirm it's actually me- and that worked fine! So it's not as though the pattern stored suddenly changed, it's just that Android is temporarily not recognizing the pattern as being correct. 

After the reset, things seemed okay...for about 2 weeks. Now the problem is back. The only solution seems to be rebooting and hoping that after swiping the pattern a few times it lets me in. 

Note that this is EVEN WITH smart lock set to keep my device unlocked at home.

,GooglePixel,"Howdy all,

I used to have PiP working on YouTube a long time ago, when it randomly stopped (I've never had a yt red subscription, which I hear would have been the issue for some). I thought nothing of it because I didn't use it a lot, I just assumed YouTube got rid of the feature.

However, I was watching a YouTube video in chrome, and that one actually went to PiP when I pressed home. 

So, is there a way to get this back on the official app? I have the setting enabled in the phones settings, but I can't find the setting in the YouTube app.  I've tried changing the alignment/rotation and various tricks involving having the video paused or playing on the minimised bar inside the app. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the app, and I can't see the option for PiP in the general settings inside the app for any of my 5 accounts.

For what it's worth I'm from the UK, as I understand location used to be an issue (but I doubt that's the problem, as it's worked before and works when on the mobile version of the website in the phone browser).

I like to listen to long form content that's only on YouTube whilst I work out, and it's very disruptive to have to stop when I want to set a rest timer, so any help would be much appreciated.

Was wondering if anyone had any recent solutions. Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"I got the Pixel while it was on sale and it arrived about 2 or 3 days ago. I was super excited about this phone and the potential it had. I set up face unlock when I was at home and off of work. I went back into work today and realized how inconvenient it is that I have to remove my mask in a hospital full of people every time I wanted to quickly unlock my phone. I heard someone say they were able to train their phone to open with a mask on so I deleted my face info and tried again with my mask on to no avail. I then took my mask off and redid the face unlock stuff and now I am unable to unlock my phone with my face. It keeps saying face not recognized.

Called the local Ubreakifix a few days ago and they stated I qualified and just needed to present my badge. I went in, presented said badge, and they said they would repair everything. Later on that night, they send me a text and state that because the phone had been ""tampered with"" during an alleged previous repair, they cannot honor the letter of their promotion which bars warrantied repairs for ""previous tampering."" I bought phone used so I don't know if it had been repaired previously or not. I read the press release by Ubreakifix again myself and then sent them a copy and also read to them that it states "" An emergency responder or healthcare professional with a Google Pixel smartphone can present his or her ID badge at any of uBreakiFix’s more than 500 participating U.S. locations to receive one free repair, regardless of the device model or type of damage. Common repairs include screen damage, charging port issues, battery replacements, camera issues, speaker issues, and even liquid damage in some cases."" I also chatted with a support staff from Ubreakifix to get a second opinion, and he stated that regardless of the condition of my pixel, whether it had been repaired previously or not, it should qualify because this was essentially an out of warranty repair and the promotional details were worded very liberally. He didn't know why the local store was taking that particular angle and advised me to reach to google, because google would be ubreakifix's guide in terms of repairs.

I chatted with Google support and explained to them the issue and the initial support person was quite supportive, stating that they would set up something with an Case ID that I could then forward to ubreakifix and ""you will be taken care of"" per the promotion details.

I sent the  Case ID  via email to  the uBreakiFix store. They then claim to have contacted Google and then came back and said that if I agree to pay about $300 to have the screen replaced, then they can proceed with evaluating and fixing whatever else is wrong with the phone. I pointed out that this again does not honor the wording of their company's promotion, as detailed specifically in their widely circulated press release. I requested that UbreakIfix conference call me in on with google support on the phone so I could hear for myself and they refused.

I once again reached out to google and advised them of what their partner in this promotion, uBreakiFix, had been doing, and they advised me that the issue had been ""escalated"" to a specialist/supervisor. It's been 3 days since this started. 

I have a collection of google products: Pixel 3, Nexuses (Nexi?), and several tablets.

My experience with Google in the past is that when they say ""escalation,"" it basically goes nowhere.

Your advice please. I came across a ""DMziggy"" while searching for ways to address this issue, but it seems that since then they have closed his support thread.

**Update** anyone experiencing this issue! Go do a factory reset on the Pixel buds. Do this by holding the ""pair"" button on the back othe battery charging case for 30 seconds. Don't let go of that button until all the lights shut off exactly after 30 seconds. Then go through the whole setup again. My buds are cured and sounds like some other folks' are fixed as well.

,GooglePixel,"Battery - https://photos.app.goo.gl/mGCJSi5otZR4nkjaA

*Edit: I mention the S20+ in here, at no point do I state that the usage situation is the same, nor do I say I comprehensively tested the battery. I am just making a point that all day battery is dependent upon the person and that unlike what most reviewers say, this phone is capable of lasting all day, your usage may vary.*

So I've seen a lot of posts about the Pixel 4 and people complaining about screen issues mostly. In the UK, the Model I bought is usually £929 but I got it on offer for £759 in April 2020 (128GB XL model).

So to start with, very fast shipping, next day!! Got the phone and sadly got a bad screen, below 50% brightness, the screen became green and got worse even lower down the scale. Now I don't hold this against Google as such, my old S10 had screen issues day one, and an annoying SMS glitch that took forever for them to fix.

So, I'm annoyed, I contacted Google through the Pixel settings app in the support section. I just explained that I did safe mode/restart/factory reset so that the conversation can move along fast. Within 3 mins, they decided to ship me a replacement, copy my data over and send the old one back. I love this service!! Wasn't without a phone at all!

Sadly the replacement had the same green tint. So I contacted the support again, explained instantly that the replacement had the same issue. I requested another replacement to be sent and that they should check for the green tint.

I got the replacement! No green tint! Weirdly I did see a purple tint, I updated the phone with the latest patch (May 2020) since it was on Jan 2020. After that update, no purple tint and certainly not green tint! Phone is in perfect condition, like new! I have to admit, despite the dodgy screen issues, this is one of the few companies (including Apple with my iPad) where repairs or replacements are so damn easy! It was painless and I wasn't stuck without a device at any point!

People forget, on forums, it's always about a phone with an issue, because if your phone works perfectly why waste time saying it on a forum lol. Every phone has an issue time to time, don't let that put you off from this awesome to use phone, Google do uphold their warranty super well.

Battery: I was concerned about battery, 3700mAh, 90Hz on 95% of the time (thanks to the April 2020 update). It only drops to 60Hz at minimum brightness which is fine. The first 3 days, the battery was average, maybe a little worse... 5hrs screen on time. However, this was only because the phone was new, I was downloading so many apps, installing, playing heavy games to try out performance, and overall just heavy heavy use! Not to mention adaptive battery probably hasn't had time to learn my app usage pattern etc.

4th and 5th day of using this phone, YouTube for 3 hrs on and off, Spotify 2hrs, calling 1hr (with my long distance GF if you're wondering why I'm on a call thaaaat long) and little indie games for a bit.

Consistently hitting 6hrs and 30mins, with 17% still to spare. As I'm typing this, I'm on 6% with 7hrs and 44mins screen on time. This ladies and gentleman, is with all features on, lift to wake, tape to wake, motion sense with Spotify (I was cooking), 90Hz on etc. Clearly this phone has more than enough battery for someone who chooses to charge overnight! Even my brother S20 plus dies at the same rate when he uses 120Hz though.

****TL;DR*****: 
Considering this phone at this time, and it's on offer? Grab it! Definitely direct from Google store. Quick, painless customer service, never without a phone, battery life is more than enough for the average user (check link) and the experience of the overall package is ace!

,GooglePixel,"The Pixel Buds arrived today and I ran them through some tests, mostly audio comparison tests vs Pixel Buds 1.

WOW, the unboxing and initial setup experience is incredible. I'm surprised reviewers did not mention this at all. It really is a quality experience right out of the box. It's easy, seamless and accompanied by a detailed yet clear and concise onscreen presentation/orientation. My Pixel 3XL detected them immediately when I opened the Pixel Buds case. I havent experienced any connection issues at all.

The case is incredible. You've seen every reviewer fall in love with the satisfying click of the case lid. The click is real. It has to be experienced. It's that good as silly as it seems. What may surprise you though is the weight of the case. Its heavier than I expected. It feels solid. This isn't a flimsy plastic case. It's well made and it does charge on the pixel stand when placed upside down.

The buds fit in my ears well with the default medium tips. You do really need to twist these buds so that they lock into your ears, or at least I do. Your ears may fit better or worse than mine but overall, they lock into my ears quite well and pass the head shake test. I also tried to flick them out of my ear with my fingers and they stayed in place just fine. They are so light in your ears. It's really nice but the best part is no more cord. I'm a pixel buds 1 user so I know that cord well and the awkward way you have to unwrap it from the case then untangle it and wrap the cord over your ears for stability. That nightmare is thankfully no more. I liked the Pixel Buds 1 despite it's issues. I never had the charging case issue and I also did not buy them. I received them for free via skymile points on my credit card. So perhaps I'm not as bitter about the buds 1 as those who paid for them but I found them to be decent. They've served me well on many bike rides.

Lets talks about audio quality. The Pixel Buds 2 are ""bright"". The bass is evident but minimized. These buds are more balanced and focused towards the mid and high end, which bring a nice sense of separation and clarity to the sound. Vocals are clear, and highs are crisp while the bass is evident in a balanced sense... It's not going to impress you if you are a bass addict. The Pixel Buds 2 do sound very nice. A lot of people tend to prefer too much bass in their music and associate it with ""quality"" but bass for the sake of bass can muddy and ruin the mids and highs. Speaking of which... the Pixel buds 1 are much louder and feature much more bass. Those of you familiar with the buds 1 will find the buds 2 to be lacking in volume and bass by comparison, HOWEVER the Buds 2 do sound better in terms of clarity and separation. The bass muddies the sound quality of the pixel buds 1. I do prefer a more balanced audio presentation, known as ""flat"" so I find the Pixel Buds 2 to sound quite good despite the bass not being overly present.

The pixel buds 2 do not get as loud as the pixel buds 1. The Buds 1 are significantly louder than the Pixel Buds 2. Although being that the buds 2 are brighter and have sharper highs, its probably better that they aren't as loud. They do get loud enough at 100% volume but expect to be up around 80%+ volume most of the time.

As for the static issue. It's there, very faintly at the end or beginning of a song (before it plays or right after it plays a song). It's also there on the pixel buds 1 although its more ""airy"" on the buds 1, where as on the buds 2, you can distinctly here a little static for a brief moment. IT DOES NOT SOUND BAD. Not on my set at least. You don't really notice it at all unless you're trying to.

So overall... the user experience, the sound, the case, the pixel buds 2 are a solid buy. They're overpriced for what they are, but I'm happy I own them. They are very nice and I think Google did an excellent job here. Could they be better? Absolutely but they're very good ear buds. They are so light, and fit incredibly well. The experience of wearing them really is a homerun compared to the pixel buds 1 and that cord.... that fucking cord :)  Seriously I didn't mind the cord, as I usually used them while exercising  but not having to fumble around with the cord while putting on the pixel buds on is so much better. I'm very happy with the Pixel Buds 1.

**EDIT: So I'm going to revise my review a little. Latency is a huge issue when playing games with the Pixel Buds 2. Unfortunately the Pixel Buds 2 do not support AptX, and only supports AAC audio. I have a $30 pair of taotronic ear buds that support aptx and they do not lag in games. A $179 pair of headphones should be able to play candy crush. I have no idea why Google didn't go with AptX when clearly there are latency issues with the pixel buds 2.**

**Music and video will not exhibit latency since the video player functions all compensate for the latency to keep sound synced with video but in games, the audio is delayed by half a second or 1 second and that completely ruins the experience.**

**BTW my $30 taotronics also exhibit the static noise issue. I think the static noise thing is a bit overblown since other bluetooh earbuds will exhibit this. I know people say samsung buds dont but there are threads of people complaining that they do too. Still, the Pixel Buds 1 didn't really exhibit the noise as bad as the pixel buds 2. The pixel buds 1 also use AAC like the pixel buds 2 but exhibit LESS LAG when playing games. WTF google. Really? How?**

Also they have latency when connected to PC that puts audio a little out of sync with video. Again my $30 taotronics have better latency.

,GooglePixel,"So a couple of months ago I went from an avid Apple user, to full on Android. And I mean Pixel 4, Pixel C, Chromebook HP x360. So far the experience has been really subpar. 
NOTE: The lions share from this experience is due to the phone not the other devices.

Details:

Pixel 4: 
Love the form factor and build. 

Display is midrange at best, no usability in sunlight (it's sunny where I live most of the time), touch accuracy ist meh at times. Another thing the forehead bothers me more than the notch tbh.

OS - ahh... I love android but there are huge perks missing from ""THE Google Phone"". Random crashes, launcher (stock) refreshes, freezes on lock screen and I'm a guy that has 7 apps installed and other than the occasional Hearthstone does NO games or intensive tasks... I wanted to try Lineage, but that beat the sense in having THE Google Flagship without the software. Honestly for that money amd hype Google should focus on R&amp;D A LOT more...
I have honestly gotten more reliable usage from a 200€ Xiaomi phone - no sh*t!

Battery life: No complaints since I turned off every possible feature that caused lower battery life - but then it hit me, I paid a lot of money for a device that can't even hold up a day with the FACTORY built in and enabled sensors.

Pixel C: 
By far the most pleasant experience I've had on a tablet running android. Fast, reliable, snappy and battery life THE BOMB!
From media consumption to office work - really good ipad replacement if on a budget.

Chromebook: An okay device, just blown up android apps are not for me.

The sync consistency between the devices has been meh at best. I use them for work and private and everything except Calendar has dissapointed me on more than one occasion.

I tried Samsung on the s10, as a second device just to see if maybe that works better and it did but I dislike the design language and feel of the devices.


All in all, a lot of compromises for the freedom of changing my launcher.

Apple you will have my money again.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna try a last-ditch effort and flash back to Android 7.0 or Android 8.0 but assuming this is a hardware issue... this is pretty much it for this phone right?&lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"I'm going crazy. Literally since I took them out of the box, I've had the same issue with my Pixel Buds paired to my Pixel 4XL. When I'm walking, they randomly pause. Or randomly play-pause-play-pause. I can't find anyone else posting about a similar issue, but if I missed something, please let me know.  

This should be the ideal pairing. Latest Google phone. Latest OS. I made sure the Pixel Buds updated to the latest firmware. I work in IT fixing people's Computers all day and maybe I'm tired/just want my brand new headphones to simply work correctly.


Here is everything I've done to troubleshoot:

1.) Factory reset them with Google Support and the issue still continues. To do this, the case has to be plugged in to charge, and then press and hold for 30 seconds with the buds case open. (this is no where on the support pages. The support rep walked me through it.)

2.) Turned off Google Assistant Integration. Problem still persists. 

3.) Turned off In-ear detection. Problem still persists. 

4.) Disabled motion controls on my Pixel 4XL.
Problem persists. 

5.) I paired the Pixel Buds to my MacBook Air 2020. No issues what to do ever. 

6.) I paired the Pixel Buds to my Pixelbook Chromebook. No issues what so ever. 

7.) Paired with old Pixel 2XL - Same issue persists.

8.) My 2 year old Jabra Elite 65ts work perfectly fine and with no issues on my Pixel 4XL. The issue only seems to happen with the Pixel Buds. 

Am I missing anything here? Everything else about the headphones is fine, but if I can't walk down the block with the Pixel Buds, I'm just going to go buy new Jabras instead.

I upgraded to a Pixel 4 from my old Essential PH-1 (which still works, just a bit slow).

,GooglePixel,"Yesterday I wrote [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/gek5h2/pixel_performance_visualized/) post comparing the progression of the performance in Google Pixel devices since the Nexus 6P. Also giving some theoretical idea of future performance. A user asked me to add some Pixel 3a data to the mix. Unfortunately I did not have the time to make more bar graphs but I did add the math to some new charts.

*\*\*If you would like to read about the flagship SOC data then head over to my previous post linked above, otherwise I will ONLY be talking about the A series and how it compares to the MAIN pixel line in this post.*

Links to Charts:

[OG Chart](https://imgur.com/W7J7fJc)

[Pixel 3A Chart](https://imgur.com/xfkR01T)

Note I made 2 charts that show how much SLOWER the A line is to the Main line, BUT I also made a chart that shows how much FASTER an 865 Pixel 5 could be. The math is reversed when doing faster vs slower percentages, and the numbers cant be reversed, therefore I made 2 charts so that you could get both sides of the picture.

Things that stand out is how the Pixel 3A was only able to beat  the OG Pixel in performance numbers. (note benchmarks aren't indicative of IRL performance FEEL). A theoretical 765G chipset in a pixel 4A wouldn't be much faster either. As a mater of fact if a Pixel 5 with an 865 series chipset was to be released, It would absolutely DECIMATE a pixel 3a, and be almost 2x faster than a 4a with a 765G. This just proves my point that buying a year old flagship handset is still a smarter long term choice than buying a budget phone. I have never bought a budget phone, I have always opted to wait for sales or wait a year for a new model to get last years flagship.

This is backed up by data. Example: You could have bought a Pixel 3 on discount once the pixel 4 came out. But some waited for the 3a hoping for a ""lower priced pixel"". In the end a used Pixel 3 would cost about the same as a New Pixel 3a, however the 3 Would be significantly faster. Some are ""waiting"" for a Pixel 4a, but in my opinion, It is smarter to just buy a half off Pixel 4 which is ALREADY significantly faster than the 765 (or any possible 700 series chip) and simply disable soli.

This is NOT a post claiming that the Pixel 5 will have a 865 chipset (although this is most logical and most likely).

""But the 865 is more expensive than the 765!"". Yes, but its not enough to cause a phone to go over the 1000$ mark. Look at the OnePlus 8 Pro. Its still at or under 1000$. The phones that are being released with the 765 G have already announced pricing at sub 450$. Unless the pixel 5 is sold for 650$ or less with a 765 and has bleeding edge hardware like 120hz displays, it will have an 865 for around 800-1000$. Someone told me it will be over 1200$, this is relatively hard to do with googles design philosophy but I won't discuss this here. These are all rumors, theory crafting, leaks etc. I stand by my logic that an 865 Pixel 5 makes perfect sense at around 800-1000$ and a 765G Pixel 4a at 400$.

Now, the reasons that the 670/765 are that much slower? Lets dive deeper:

1. Half the memory bandwidth of even a snapdragon 835
2. Dual channel memory controller vs Quad channel
3. Less CPU cache
4. Only 2 High performance cores (and 6 low performance) unlike the 800 series that has 4 high performance cores)

This is honestly all it takes to kill a cpu's performance. This is backed up by how Desktop CPU benchmarks can greatly fluctuate with different ram configs and speeds. This is also how the Desktop GPU market segregates its GPU tiers using the same Chip but slower memory (See RX5600xt vs RX5700). If a chip can't be fed enough data, it simply wont perform. The 670 also only has 2 high performance cores, meaning PEAK performance will be HALF of the 845 of its big brother Pixel 3.

As for the 765. Many thing that just because its a 700 series that its faster than a 600 series and gets close to an 800 series. This is FALSE. The 700 series in some way is even more compromised than the 600 series. It uses 1 high performance core, and 1 medium performance core and 6 low performance cores. This boosts efficiency and battery life ALOT but its a compromised design to using 2 high performance cores and 6 low performance cores. Sure it is still faster because it uses a newer A76 based CPU design vs the older A75, but if it was using the older A75 it wouldn't be faster than the old 670 chip. The 700 series isn't at all higher tier than a 600 series. It again has less than half the memory bandwidth (17gbps vs 44gbps on the 865). It has a MUCH slower GPU, again less than half the speed. The parts where the 765 outshines the 600 series is in the modems and ISP. Its image signal processor is significantly faster, and the modem is capable of 5G and gets within spitting distance of the 800 series.

Hope this makes sense. You can find all of this info online to check for yourself. I'm simply consolidating it into something easier to understand. Enjoy

EDIT:

Also, since some thing that the 4a may have a SD730 chip. One I think this is plane stupid as it offers no real upgrades of the 670 other than efficiency, and Two, I'm giving the 4a a ""best case scenario"" approach. Imagine an even slower chip. HA!

Features include: (+ / - /=) compared to Pixel Buds

\+ Active Noise Cancelling

On paper, for $20 more it seems you are getting A LOT more out of these than the Pixel Buds, and I'm not seeing any advantages from the Pixel Buds other than the Google Translate feature.

,GooglePixel,"Three years ago I made the switch from Apple to Android and I'm so happy I made the change. I've really fell in love with my Pixel 2 XL for its simple, refreshing OS experience, beautiful display, and solid camera. However, its age is starting to show - I've recently been experiencing horrible battery life (dies around afternoon-evening daily), dead pixels, sluggish performance, and random GPS errors.

Now is the time for a new phone. I've narrowed it down to two/three options: the OnePlus 8, or the Pixel 4 XL / Pixel 4a XL (which is to be released soon). I'm really partial to the simple Android experience that the Pixel offers, but I've read a lot of solid reviews on these new OnePlus phones and how the OS is very similar in simplicity. The other factor is 5G and whether I really need it or not. On one hand, it would be nice to be future-proofed and have access to faster speeds. But on the other hand, 5G isn't readily available everywhere yet. Is it a must-have if you're going to be spending good money on a smartphone in 2020?

**OnePlus 8 (5G ready)**

Through Verizon, I can get $350 credited to my account by trading in my old phone, free 5G access ($10/month value), and a $150 Verizon gift card. Payment would be $33.33/month for 24 months, not taking into account those discounts.

This phone has the best processor of the bunch and is 5G ready - also has the best battery life. Seems like the OS is very similar to the Pixel's, so that's a plus to me.

Camera seems to come up quite often as a negative in reviews, but that's not necessarily a deal breaker for me. Would probably still be an upgrade over my Pixel 2 camera. Display also seems pretty average at 1080x2400, 402ppi and I'm not sure if the curved edges will bother me or not. Aesthetically speaking, it's not my favorite looking phone. I prefer the simpler matte design of the Pixel phones.

**Pixel 4 XL (4G)**

It's currently on sale for $599 on Google's website, or $24.96/month for 24 months.

As I mentioned before I loved my Pixel 2 XL and its OS, so this was the first phone that came to mind. Seems to have a really nice QHD display, a really nice camera, and I'm absolutely in love with its design and how it looks. That said, even at the discounted price its specs seem to be pretty average. I've also read a lot about the poor battery life which isn't ideal.

**Pixel 4a XL (rumored to be 5G ready)**

It's supposed to be around $499 or so for the 4a XL version, though not sure. Rumored to come out sometime this month I believe.

If they include the Snapdragon 765 5g processor in this phone, it could be the cheapest 5G device out there. It's also rumored that the battery will be improved this time around.

,GooglePixel,"Hey r/GooglePixel,

Do you think it's logical to switch from a OP6 (128gb / 8gb RAM) to the 4a? I know specs wise its probably considered a downgrade.... but, although OP is the closest you'll come to vanilla android I have always been considering moving back to Google's own products (Ever since owning a Nexus 5 and 6P).

Thanks!

When I do turn bluetooth on:

1. It takes a solid 2-5 minutes at attempting to turn bluetooth on
2. Bluetooth does not turn on
3. Bluetooth occasionally turns on and I will get a ""bluetooth keeps stopping"" error and have to force stop bluetooth to make the phone work

\- Jabra 75t: I can get them renewed on Amazon for $120. That's the most I would want to spend. They seem solid overall so these are frontrunners.

\- Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2: I don't love the airpods looks but they seems solid and good for calls which I like. I also like the slim profile of the case. The price is way less than the Jabra's right now ($80 on Amazon) so if these are comparable, I would probably go with them. I have heard about connectivity issues...

\- Fiil T1X: I originally ordered these but the company that ships them is having issues from COVID so I have no idea when they would actually come. I requested a cancellation and am moving on to other options that I can actually have shipped!

,GooglePixel,"I've read in several threads that if you buy an unlocked Pixel from Best Buy w/ Sprint activation to get a discount that they relock the phone to Sprint. 

This is NOT true, I even inserted the Sprint sim into the Pixel 4 XL and activated service. I'm using the Pixel with T-Mobile now and bootloader unlocking is also available. I've since moved the Sprint sim to my Pixel 3a XL and activated it there, but I'm planning to cancel service within the month.

$499 for a Pixel 4 XL is way worth it and with Sprint Satisfaction Guarantee you don't pay anything if you decide not to keep service. Only downside is a Credit Pull from Sprint (even w/ Kickstart) and the only option is to port a number in as setting up a new number requires a Best Buy appointment.

,GooglePixel,"Hi all just got the pixel 2xl and I gotta say it's pretty good. Games fly and don't stutter like they use to with my V20. I know this phone has no SD card slot. I thought this wouldn't be a problem for me because I would just OTG and play my emulated games that way. 

Here's the problem: The apps that are installed on the phone have no access to the OTG. I have enabled storage access, but they don't show up. CX file manager can see it and manage it, but there is no way for the apps to find the storage.  

1. Is there a system in Android which would allow me to create a link to the files on the OTG on the main storage? (Like a shortcut)

2. Why can't I format as internal storage? I thought this was available before I updated to the latest Android, but I'm not sure as I have never had to use it.

3. Is there any OTHER way to figure it out? Am I missing something? (Besides my ability to expand my storage in seconds)

Games fly and don&amp;#39;t stutter like they use to with my V20. I know this phone has no SD card slot. I thought this wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem for me because I would just OTG and play my emulated games that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the problem: The apps that are installed on the phone have no access to the OTG. I have enabled storage access, but they don&amp;#39;t show up. CX file manager can see it and manage it, but there is no way for the apps to find the storage.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a system in Android which would allow me to create a link to the files on the OTG on the main storage? (Like a shortcut)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,GooglePixel,"I finished up most of my work at the office yesterday, so today I got bored and decided to see what the actual performance change was for mobile. Even though it seems to have ""stagnated"", I think that it has hit a similar issue as our PC components. Even though the performance has increased, the workload has become more complex and requires more resources to achieve similar performance to yesteryear.

So...I made [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/kXSa9BZ) little chart real quick.

As one can see, there has been a steady performance change over time. The worst increase being the multicore from the 6p to the Pixel 1 XL. This is due to cutting the amount of cores in HALF, while increasing the single core performance by 27%. There was almost a relatively small 15% increase in single core performance from the Pixel 1 to the Pixel 2. The biggest performance gains so far came from the Pixel 4 which is roughly double that for the 6P the Pixel line replaced.

Interesting things to note. If the snapdragon 820 didn't cut its number of cores in half (and using an average 3.77 multicore to single core coefficient) then the 820 8 core score would be 1229, a 40% mutlcore increase from the 6P. This would be in line with the Pixel 2 which was an 80% improvement over the 6p (this equates to roughly 40-45% gains per year vs baseline).

Why the big jump from the 835 and onward? Well based on some research I conducted, there are 3 main factors that contributed to this.

1. Node shrink (from 14nm to 10/7nm)
2. Changing from Dual channel to Quad Channel memory. Since increasing memory speed requires more voltage, the choice was made to increase memory bandwidth by doubling access channels.
3. Doubling CPU cache as well as adding a L3 cache in the 845 series which reduced memory usage significantly.

Also, about the snapdragon 865 that could be in the pixel 5. Using numbers from the galaxy s20 (single core 839, multicore 3104 AT BEST). The pixel 5 would be ONLY a 12% improvement single core year over year, and 15% improvement multicore YOY. This would be the smallest YOY change to date in processor performance. The 865 also offers support for LPDDR5 quad channel memory which lowers the required voltage for memory. The biggest improvement in this SoC is going to be the GPU which increases ALU's and ROP's by 50% while still lowering power consumption.

Of course, I digress, processor performance isn't the only thing that matters in a smartphone, but it is pretty important (as well as ram latency, bandwidth, gpu efficiency, overall efficiency, etc).

Hope this was interesting.

,GooglePixel," So, about two months ago, I dropped my Pixel 2 XL pretty badly. It was inside of a case, but it fell pretty hard on a tile floor.

About 15 minutes later, the screen started blinking on and off, and then eventually the screen came up saying that I needed to factory reset the phone.

I did this, and then the phone worked fine...UNTIL I tried to restore the phone from a previous back up (saved about 12 hours before the dropping incident). After this restore, it would begin the screen would begin blinking again and I would be asked to do the factory reset again. After going through this cycle a few times, I just accepted that I wouldn't be able to restore my phone, and went about reinstalling all of my apps, changing back all of my settings, etc. It took me all morning to do and I lost about half a day of work productivity (working at home due to COVID 19--my phone is very important for work).

Fast forward two months to now. Last night (I think?) my phone battery died while I was asleep. I woke up, and put it on the charger, and I came back to it about an hour later. When I turned it on, it was blinking again and asking me to factory reset it. I didn't drop it or anything. Again, after trying to use a saved backup of my phone, the blinking would continue. So, I tried restoring a from a back-up of my phone, but NOT restoring settings and features. This worked. However, I still lost about half a day of working, and it was a big pain in the butt.

Does anyone know what's going on here? How can I prevent this from happening again? I've had this phone for about two years (almost have it paid off!) and it's been dropped quite a few times. Hoping there's a solution other than having to deal with it or buying a new phone.

,GooglePixel,"Hi All,

So due to my diabetes I have had to upgrade to an iPhone 11. It's a long story but it involves looping and can only really be done with an iPhone with the setup I have. I thought it'd be fun to do an exit style interview/review like when you'd leave a company.

**So what made you buy a Pixel and what model did you have?**

I was an iPhone user since the original. I had the 2G, 3G, 4 and 5 and then switched over to android. The Samsung Note 4 was my first droid and it was great but the battery life was horrible. Next up we had the HTC 10 - I wanted those front speakers and it was great, until the battery crapped out after about 1.5 years with it. I decided on the Pixel 3 XL as the camera looked amazing and like the rest of us wanted that stock android experience. I went with the 128GB model but quickly realised that 64GB would have been fine.

**How was your experience with the Pixel 3 XL?**

I loved it. This was the first phone that I was sad to see go on the day of the upgrade. Usually upgrade days are happy and filled with excitement. The excitement was there but nothing like times passed. The problem was that the Pixel 3 XL was still a great phone with an amazing camera. Sure it had it's quirks like the speaker profiles at different volumes but other than that it was an awesome phone.

**Any regrets buying the 3XL on launch day?**

Not really - as a UK user though I have been really disappointed by the lack of call screening - even after 1.5 years it's still not there? This seems to be an ongoing theme that Google are totally focused on the American market (I still can't get the Pixel buds 2 for example).

**Is the Pixel 3 XL still viable in 2020?**

Yes it is an I'd implore you to check it out as an option if you're trying to pick one up second hand.

**You said you were sad to be upgrading, can you explain further?**

Usually when upgrading I'd be to the point where I'm 100% done and fed up with a phone. Usually it'd be the battery or laggy performance that would have wound me up to the point of driving over the phone with my car. But the 3XL was different. I didn't need to upgrade and I'd have been totally happy using the phone until the end of it's life. I will miss the unlimited photo uploads that are automatic the most I think. I'm so used to taking 50 photos in 5 mins just because I can - that'll have to change with the iPhone.

**Would you ever come back to Pixel?**

I totally would - my experience has been top notch and I didn't ever have any problems - I know there are a lot of people who have had issues but for me it's been painless. If there's an option in the coming years to loop using the setup I have for my diabetes on Pixel, I'd be back in a heartbeat.

**How are you finding the iPhone 11 so far?**

Well it's not my Pixel 3 XL but it's been pretty good so far - haven't had the same excitement I had when setting up the Pixel but it's been ok. iOS and Android are quite similar at this point with a few differences. I miss being able to swipe as a back button though, a lot of iOS apps don't support this and you have to go hunting for the back button. The camera is decent and I've taken some really good shots.

Edit: wow thanks for my first gold kind stranger!! I’m touched :)",t2_3cnygjp,False,,1,False,Pixel 3 XL: An Exit Interview,[],r/GooglePixel,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gegci7,False,dark,0.9,,public,83,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,83,,True,self,1588786866.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1588783965.0,text,6,,,text,self.GooglePixel,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So due to my diabetes I have had to upgrade to an iPhone 11. It&amp;#39;s a long story but it involves looping and can only really be done with an iPhone with the setup I have. I thought it&amp;#39;d be fun to do an exit style interview/review like when you&amp;#39;d leave a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what made you buy a Pixel and what model did you have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an iPhone user since the original. I had the 2G, 3G, 4 and 5 and then switched over to android. The Samsung Note 4 was my first droid and it was great but the battery life was horrible. Next up we had the HTC 10 - I wanted those front speakers and it was great, until the battery crapped out after about 1.5 years with it. I decided on the Pixel 3 XL as the camera looked amazing and like the rest of us wanted that stock android experience. I went with the 128GB model but quickly realised that 64GB would have been fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was your experience with the Pixel 3 XL?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it. This was the first phone that I was sad to see go on the day of the upgrade. Usually upgrade days are happy and filled with excitement. The excitement was there but nothing like times passed. The problem was that the Pixel 3 XL was still a great phone with an amazing camera. Sure it had it&amp;#39;s quirks like the speaker profiles at different volumes but other than that it was an awesome phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any regrets buying the 3XL on launch day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really - as a UK user though I have been really disappointed by the lack of call screening - even after 1.5 years it&amp;#39;s still not there? This seems to be an ongoing theme that Google are totally focused on the American market (I still can&amp;#39;t get the Pixel buds 2 for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Pixel 3 XL still viable in 2020?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it is an I&amp;#39;d implore you to check it out as an option if you&amp;#39;re trying to pick one up second hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said you were sad to be upgrading, can you explain further?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually when upgrading I&amp;#39;d be to the point where I&amp;#39;m 100% done and fed up with a phone. Usually it&amp;#39;d be the battery or laggy performance that would have wound me up to the point of driving over the phone with my car. But the 3XL was different. I didn&amp;#39;t need to upgrade and I&amp;#39;d have been totally happy using the phone until the end of it&amp;#39;s life. I will miss the unlimited photo uploads that are automatic the most I think. I&amp;#39;m so used to taking 50 photos in 5 mins just because I can - that&amp;#39;ll have to change with the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you ever come back to Pixel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally would - my experience has been top notch and I didn&amp;#39;t ever have any problems - I know there are a lot of people who have had issues but for me it&amp;#39;s been painless. If there&amp;#39;s an option in the coming years to loop using the setup I have for my diabetes on Pixel, I&amp;#39;d be back in a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you finding the iPhone 11 so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;#39;s not my Pixel 3 XL but it&amp;#39;s been pretty good so far - haven&amp;#39;t had the same excitement I had when setting up the Pixel but it&amp;#39;s been ok. iOS and Android are quite similar at this point with a few differences. I miss being able to swipe as a back button though, a lot of iOS apps don&amp;#39;t support this and you have to go hunting for the back button. The camera is decent and I&amp;#39;ve taken some really good shots. Switching over to the gesture navigation on the Pixel when it came out has really helped the transition. &lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"Hi gang:

After my gf inherited my Jabra elite active 65t buds (she liked them but not enough purchase a pair), I've been on-and-off searching for a good pair of earbuds to use. I was going to jump on the new Google earbuds, but reviews have been polarizing. So I come to you for your input after making a pros &amp; cons table, to assist me with my decision. I'm not an audiophile; as long as the transmission does not resemble dial-up, I'm good.

I've also thought about purchasing a refurbished/used 65t model (they go for $120 and are similar to the Google earbuds in terms of battery life), since they're still *good*, but not great with the new gen of earbuds. Let me know of your input. Thank you all in advance.

,GooglePixel,"Just before I start, I have a Pixel 3XL, before I got the buds I set the AVRCP version to 1.6, and the buds have been on firmware version 225 since I got them(not sure if they were like that out of the box or if they updated immediately after I set them up, cause I put them right back in the case for the drive to my house.) I've been using the original BT Pixel buds, and rarely used the USB-C buds because frankly, I didn't like the sound from those or the wire. I got these yesterday at about 4PM but have used them a lot since then, probably a total of 6-7 hours.

Edit: I didn't realize, but the bluetooth audio codec I'm using is AAC, not system default (whatever that is)

&amp;#x200B;

As an aside, this post is over 3000 words long, the equivalent of a 10ish page MLA format paper, and took me 2 hours to write, so I'd grab a drink and a snack if I were you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Setup:** Incredibly easy. Just pop open the case, get a banner at the top of your phone screen, tap on it, go through the tutorial if you want, give it access to assistant, change the size of the buds if you need to, whatever. Compared to the old Pbuds, which were supposed to have fast pairing (which I never got to work), these are great.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sound:**

\-Media: They don't seem quite as full as the original Pixel buds, nor do they seem to get quite as loud. I wish Google would add some EQ profiles as well as something to fiddle around with where you can adjust it to your specific preferences, but really these are no slouch. I've already heard some details in my music that I wasn't able to hear before, but at the same time, the bass doesn't seem like the warm, low noise I've become accustomed to. After reading that soundguys post I might fiddle around more with the size of the tips, because apparently that can change what you hear by quite a lot, but these are just initial impressions. I've listened to some classical music (Shostakovitch, Mennin), some funk rock (Primus), and some alternative/antifolk/glam pop (of Montreal) and I was never disappointed with anything but the bass heavy stuff, and even with that you quickly forget that it's lacking until you listen to other headphones.  I may be biased toward bass heavy speakers/earbuds though, because in my car I set the EQ profile to a V shape, and maybe the original BT buds were bass heavy as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also watched a lot of video (movie on my pixelbook, some youtube on my phone and my pixelbook, videos on twitter mobile), and the audio seems to be pretty good there as well. There's a very tiny delay between what I see on the screen and the audio, but it's barely perceptible. I'd peg it at a.1-.2 second delay.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really get any hiss, which I actually got a decent amount of on the OG BT Pixel Buds whenever the drivers were activated, and which annoyed the hell out of me. I've tested it on youtube videos and Shostakovitch 11, which has a lot of very quiet sections, but no podcasts yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The vent they have to reduce the plugged feeling and allow some noise to come through works pretty well. With audio turned off/way down I can hear people talking easily, but my brain can't filter through loud music to understand speech for some reason, a problem I've always had (not with lyrics, I'm not sure why), but I can hear that speech is happening outside the buds up until about 2/3rds volume before it's a challenge. I can hear the sound of cars driving by on the street up until 80%, then I have to be actively listening for road noise to hear them. A downside is I can hear myself singing along to my music too well. Adaptive sound is nice, but I've only noticed it happening when I flush the toilet and the reservoir is filling back up/I'm washing my hands. Maybe it's happened other times, but I haven't noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick edit: I really went for it just now when pushing these things into my ears, with the small tips, nothing crazy, they're still comfortable but bass seems a LOT better now. The beginning of the song Gelid Ascent by of Montreal has a very low hum in the beginning that's normally difficult to hear unless you listen for it actively, and for about a year I didn't even know it was there despite listening to the song dozens of times, but this time I wasn't even listening for it and I heard it. Color me impressed. Everything is still nice and clean, but the bass is definitely more present now. The sound also feels more full.

&amp;#x200B;

**Comfort and fit:**

The longest I've worn these continuously has been 3 hours, during that time, there was a little bit of discomfort, but nothing too serious. I would say the wingtip/""thorn"" is the thing that causes the discomfort. When I first put them in I can tell that they're there, but I forget about them pretty quickly. As for the fit, they're great. I went for a run this morning and really went for it at the end, breaking into a borderline sprint. I didn't have to adjust the buds the entire way, something I would never be able to say for my old Pixel Buds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mic quality/calls:**

For some reason, I can't get parrot to record audio through these, even when I set the app to prefer bluetooth devices for audio capture.  I did notice that it said on the app that audio recorded through bluetooth would be recorded at 8000hz, whereas audio recorded on my phone mics can go up to 44100hz. This, I think, is the reason why on all the mic tests we hear for bluetooth earbuds, audio quality is just gross. It's true that in the verge mic test the buds were the worst, but I feel like even if they are the worst out of the ones tested, they're all capable of much better sound recording. Maybe I'm an idiot though and don't know what I'm talking about. The Google recorder doesn't let you record audio through the buds for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

For calls, they're great. I've been in my car with the AC blasting, walking outside near a roadway with wind, and inside my own quiet house and on all these calls people reported solid call quality, whereas with the original BT buds people would tell me they had trouble hearing me, and a few of my friends even made fun of me for the call quality, so certainly a step up here.

&amp;#x200B;

Google assistant picks up my voice well, hasn't misheard me once, even when I was wearing mask at a crowded Walmart.

&amp;#x200B;

**Connection:**

Like I said, before I began using these I set my phones AVRCP version to 1.6 in the developer settings, and have not had any connection issues with my phone. I first tested them by leaving my phone in my room on the Pixel stand, and walking around the house, and then outside. It's a medium sized house, and I probably went 40-50 feet from the phone without the buds disconnecting. Problems only arose when I went to my fridge and had the fridge in between the phone and myself, and when I went around the far side of my car from the buds. They don't like having tons of metal/electricity between them and the device they're connected to, big surprise.
[This is where I tested](https://imgur.com/a/gMxBTxx), held went to the center of the lot as far from everything else as I could get, nothing for maybe 20-30 feet in any direction but the trees you can see, a maintenance worker kicked me off the field. Held my phone behind my butt used my other hand to block one earbud at a time, turned my head, no disconnects. 

&amp;#x200B;

The buds stay connected to one another very well regardless of where I am, whether it be in a parking lot, running across a bridge with a wide road on one side of me and a sheer drop-off into a canyon on the other side, crossing the street, whatever. I've cupped my hands over both buds when I was inside too in an effort to make them disconnect and it's only happened once even when cupping both buds tightly. Tomorrow I might run into the middle of a field just to confirm that the connection is decent in all situations. Worth mentioning, I had my phone in my right hand the whole time I was running so it wouldn't shake around in my workout shorts, but I'll test further on that bridge with my phone in back/side pockets later.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real connection issue I've had is when I connected the buds to my Pixelbook and for some reason it kicked them off, and after that I had to reset the buds in order to make them connect to both my Pixelbook and my phone. I also tried to pair them to my old Windows laptop today with no success, but that thing isn't doing too well, so it might be the computer/my ineptitude.

&amp;#x200B;

**Battery:**

Yesterday wasn't a great day for battery on these. I began testing the battery at 6:20PM and by about 8:30PM the one with lower battery was at about 20%. I didn't check the notification because I had dismissed it, but in quick settings it only reports the battery of the bud with lower battery so I don't have detailed info about yesterday. I continued to wear them until half after 9, and they didn't die, but I didn't check the battery on either of them after. I've also noticed that the algorithm which Google has talked about that's supposed to help the buds trade off jobs doesn't seem very aggressive at all on my buds, and I have done a reset for that. As of writing this, I've had them off the charger for an hour, listening to music nonstop at 70-80% volume, and the left bud has 68% battery to the right buds 90%. Yesterday and this morning the right but was the one draining faster, so hopefully they average out over time such that there's not uneven battery wear on them. The average of the two is 21%, so assuming they switch at the right time, it's conceivable that they could hit 5 hours of playtime, or even more with lower volume.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the battery in the case, for a while it was only reporting 100% after charging the buds up a little bit. I thought it was broken, and I reset it last night. Maybe it was a bug, but I'm also finding that the case doesn't drain very quickly at all when charging the buds. I charged the case up w/o/ checking the battery level on it prior after I finished using the buds last night, which I wish I hadn't done so I could get a more accurate idea of how much battery it lost charging the buds after the 3 hours of listening, but today I'd estimate that I've used the buds for about 2 hours not counting the more recent hour, and I haven't charged the case at all. I just checked, and it was at 88%. 12% missing from 2 hours of charging. With an advertised (I think) 19 hours of battery in the case, 2 hours of charge is about 10.5% of those 19 hours. Extrapolating with some math, that looks like about 16.6 hours of actual charge time in the case, at least for me. I took a few calls and I've been playing my music loudly though, and using the assistant some, so maybe I'm just unusually hard on the battery and the 19 hours holds up for the average consumer.

&amp;#x200B;

The Buds charge in the case so quickly that I don't even care to check if it's as fast as advertised (others are saying it is). I know that I'm never going to have an issue with the buds being out of battery for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

Another quick edit: It's been another hour since I wrote the battery section, left bud 32%, right 78%. Kinda pissed that the algorithm still hasn't kicked in, but there's still time, especially seeing that one drains at roughly 3x the rate of the other, so if they switched right now they would even out at about 10%. Maybe they're just screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

6 minutes after that, left bud is at 31% and the right is at 76%. Another minute, staring at the percentages, left 31%, right 75%, Looks like the algorithm just kicked in. I'm gonna keep listening and see if they end up at around 10% at the same time, then I'll edit this post. As it stands I'm finishing up the final section prior to TL;DR (Obviously needed) and I don't want to wait 2.5 hours to post this.

&amp;#x200B;

They lasted 3 hours and 57 minutes. Left bud died first when right was at 4%. Waited for the right to die, and now after 20 minutes in the case it's at 82%, which I think is outstanding. Left, which had an extra 5 minutes of charging on the right one, is at 85%. So like phones, the buds charge rapidly at first before slowing down significantly as they near a full charge.


New update: Just went for a morning run, my connection test from this morning is already posted with a picture of where it was done. My run started about 40 minutes ago, I just checked the buds battery. I had them at 100% volume the whole time because I want tinnitus. They're both at 84%. Seems like they're draining evenly now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Design and build:**

I think they look great, the buds are lightweight, the case feels solid, I love how it snaps closed, I love how the buds are pulled into place by the magnets, I love how small the case is, I love ALMOST everything about the design and build, except that the case picks up dark marks easily (though you can rub em off with your fingers, jeans, whatever), and I don't like that the lid has about a quarter to a half a mm of play from right to left whether it's open or closed, but it's infinitely better than the case of the original buds, which always felt and looked like it was about to snap in half.

&amp;#x200B;

The lights they included are a big step up. For those who don't remember the original buds had 3 lights, all of which were on the inside the case, side by side, and they served double duty in reporting the battery of the buds and the case. You had to click the button in the case if you wanted to get the battery of the case, or the battery of the buds, and sometimes it got confusing. On the new buds you have a light inside the case which gives you the status of the buds, and a light on the outside of the case which gives you the status of the case. The old case also misreported the case battery all the time, and I had to shave off a lot of silicon from the buds to get the metal contacts on the buds to stay connected with the case. Even after that, the buds often came disconnected from the case and paired to your phone while they were in your pocket. I've had to pull over so many times to disconnect them so I could keep listening to music in my car you wouldn't believe it. I have had no issues like these with the Buds gen 2.

&amp;#x200B;

The buds 2 protrude from my ears a tiny bit, and I don't really want to lie down on a pillow with them but if I did do that it wouldn't be a huge issue. Compared to the original buds, these things are tiny and very attractive. My only real wish is that you could unscrew and replace the mesh cover with a new one. Traditionally, when the mesh gets waxy I've taken blue tac to my earbuds, but on the original buds that ended up tearing out the mesh cover of one, and I had to use a needle, tweezers, and superglue to reapply it. A replaceable mesh cover would eliminate the need for blue tac, and keep me from getting too worried. As it stands I've been cleaning out my ears before using these when I remember to and they've remained pretty clean. I don't have super waxy ears or anything, but when I get really busy with school, making sure I clean my ears isn't at the forefront of my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intangibles:**

I went through hell getting these things. My family can see my bank account and I don't have a ton of money, so I didn't want to order these on my card or else they'd be on my ass about it, but I did have a good amount of cash on hand, so I went and picked up a prepaid visa card from Rite Aid. It took like 5 hours to get the thing activated, I spent a ton of time on the phone on hold, hanging up, calling again, and researching ways to fix it myself because I feared I would never actually be helped.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time I thought I would be moving into a new place the next day, so when I ordered I ordered from beach camera on April 30th, and their site said I could have them delivered by May 1st, so I dropped the extra $19 for 1 day shipping, and they ended up being about $207 all together. The website was wrong, they shipped the next day, and they only arrived yesterday on Monday, and their customer service refused to reimburse me for the 1 day shipping despite the site giving me the wrong info.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, May 1st, the guy I was supposed to be moving in with ghosted me after I had taken apart all my furniture and packed my stuff up. I tried to get in contact with him about the package, but he ignored my texts, and if your packages arrive at another person's house, that person owns them, so I spent 7 hours sitting in my car with shitty AC outside this guys house in the sun yesterday so I could intercept the FedEx driver and show them my ID before he got the buds and was allowed to keep them.

&amp;#x200B;

Gas cost for the car idling all day so I could run my AC + extra shipping cost was $34, and 7 hours of discomfort and boredom, plus the opportunity cost of not using that time for school.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all that, and losing time I could have used to work on school work, I still feel like these were worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final thoughts, speculation:**

So my right bud just died, after the left died 5 minutes before it. When the left died the right had 4%. That's a total time of 3 hours 57 minutes. By the way, having plugged the left bug into the case at 7:52, it's at 33% right now 8 minutes later. The right bud after 4 minutes of charging, is at 21%. I'm not sure about this, but given Google's history of doing staged rollouts of features and A/B testing, it's possible that they're testing builds which prioritize connectivity over battery life and vice versa. Or maybe the battery life is only cut down cause of my phone settings, or how I was using the buds. Anything is a possibility with Google though. Just an aside.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Easy setup, awesome sound, comfortable, good call quality for me and the people on the other end, strong connection, decent battery(though when the algorithm takes forever to kick in it's worrying), ultra fast charging, spectacular build and design, and the best purchase I've made in a long time in terms of value.

I&amp;#39;ve been using the original BT Pixel buds, and rarely used the USB-C buds because frankly, I didn&amp;#39;t like the sound from those or the wire. I got these yesterday at about 4PM but have used them a lot since then, probably a total of 6-7 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I didn&amp;#39;t realize, but the bluetooth audio codec I&amp;#39;m using is AAC, not system default (whatever that is)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, this post is over 3000 words long, the equivalent of a 10ish page MLA format paper, and took me 2 hours to write, so I&amp;#39;d grab a drink and a snack if I were you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup:&lt;/strong&gt; Incredibly easy. Just pop open the case, get a banner at the top of your phone screen, tap on it, go through the tutorial if you want, give it access to assistant, change the size of the buds if you need to, whatever. Compared to the old Pbuds, which were supposed to have fast pairing (which I never got to work), these are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Media: They don&amp;#39;t seem quite as full as the original Pixel buds, nor do they seem to get quite as loud. I wish Google would add some EQ profiles as well as something to fiddle around with where you can adjust it to your specific preferences, but really these are no slouch. I&amp;#39;ve already heard some details in my music that I wasn&amp;#39;t able to hear before, but at the same time, the bass doesn&amp;#39;t seem like the warm, low noise I&amp;#39;ve become accustomed to. After reading that soundguys post I might fiddle around more with the size of the tips, because apparently that can change what you hear by quite a lot, but these are just initial impressions. I&amp;#39;ve listened to some classical music (Shostakovitch, Mennin), some funk rock (Primus), and some alternative/antifolk/glam pop (of Montreal) and I was never disappointed with anything but the bass heavy stuff, and even with that you quickly forget that it&amp;#39;s lacking until you listen to other headphones.  I may be biased toward bass heavy speakers/earbuds though, because in my car I set the EQ profile to a V shape, and maybe the original BT buds were bass heavy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also watched a lot of video (movie on my pixelbook, some youtube on my phone and my pixelbook, videos on twitter mobile), and the audio seems to be pretty good there as well. There&amp;#39;s a very tiny delay between what I see on the screen and the audio, but it&amp;#39;s barely perceptible. I&amp;#39;d peg it at a.1-.2 second delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really get any hiss, which I actually got a decent amount of on the OG BT Pixel Buds whenever the drivers were activated, and which annoyed the hell out of me. I&amp;#39;ve tested it on youtube videos and Shostakovitch 11, which has a lot of very quiet sections, but no podcasts yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vent they have to reduce the plugged feeling and allow some noise to come through works pretty well. With audio turned off/way down I can hear people talking easily, but my brain can&amp;#39;t filter through loud music to understand speech for some reason, a problem I&amp;#39;ve always had (not with lyrics, I&amp;#39;m not sure why), but I can hear that speech is happening outside the buds up until about 2/3rds volume before it&amp;#39;s a challenge. I can hear the sound of cars driving by on the street up until 80%, then I have to be actively listening for road noise to hear them. A downside is I can hear myself singing along to my music too well. Adaptive sound is nice, but I&amp;#39;ve only noticed it happening when I flush the toilet and the reservoir is filling back up/I&amp;#39;m washing my hands. Maybe it&amp;#39;s happened other times, but I haven&amp;#39;t noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 minutes after that, left bud is at 31% and the right is at 76%. Another minute, staring at the percentages, left 31%, right 75%, Looks like the algorithm just kicked in. I&amp;#39;m gonna keep listening and see if they end up at around 10% at the same time, then I&amp;#39;ll edit this post. As it stands I&amp;#39;m finishing up the final section prior to TL;DR (Obviously needed) and I don&amp;#39;t want to wait 2.5 hours to post this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They lasted 3 hours and 57 minutes. Left bud died first when right was at 4%. Waited for the right to die, and now after 20 minutes in the case it&amp;#39;s at 82%, which I think is outstanding. Left, which had an extra 5 minutes of charging on the right one, is at 85%. So like phones, the buds charge rapidly at first before slowing down significantly as they near a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New update: Just went for a morning run, my connection test from this morning is already posted with a picture of where it was done. My run started about 40 minutes ago, I just checked the buds battery. I had them at 100% volume the whole time because I want tinnitus. They&amp;#39;re both at 84%. Seems like they&amp;#39;re draining evenly now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and build:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they look great, the buds are lightweight, the case feels solid, I love how it snaps closed, I love how the buds are pulled into place by the magnets, I love how small the case is, I love ALMOST everything about the design and build, except that the case picks up dark marks easily (though you can rub em off with your fingers, jeans, whatever), and I don&amp;#39;t like that the lid has about a quarter to a half a mm of play from right to left whether it&amp;#39;s open or closed, but it&amp;#39;s infinitely better than the case of the original buds, which always felt and looked like it was about to snap in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lights they included are a big step up. For those who don&amp;#39;t remember the original buds had 3 lights, all of which were on the inside the case, side by side, and they served double duty in reporting the battery of the buds and the case. You had to click the button in the case if you wanted to get the battery of the case, or the battery of the buds, and sometimes it got confusing. On the new buds you have a light inside the case which gives you the status of the buds, and a light on the outside of the case which gives you the status of the case. The old case also misreported the case battery all the time, and I had to shave off a lot of silicon from the buds to get the metal contacts on the buds to stay connected with the case. Even after that, the buds often came disconnected from the case and paired to your phone while they were in your pocket. I&amp;#39;ve had to pull over so many times to disconnect them so I could keep listening to music in my car you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe it. I have had no issues like these with the Buds gen 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buds 2 protrude from my ears a tiny bit, and I don&amp;#39;t really want to lie down on a pillow with them but if I did do that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a huge issue. Compared to the original buds, these things are tiny and very attractive. My only real wish is that you could unscrew and replace the mesh cover with a new one. Traditionally, when the mesh gets waxy I&amp;#39;ve taken blue tac to my earbuds, but on the original buds that ended up tearing out the mesh cover of one, and I had to use a needle, tweezers, and superglue to reapply it. A replaceable mesh cover would eliminate the need for blue tac, and keep me from getting too worried. As it stands I&amp;#39;ve been cleaning out my ears before using these when I remember to and they&amp;#39;ve remained pretty clean. I don&amp;#39;t have super waxy ears or anything, but when I get really busy with school, making sure I clean my ears isn&amp;#39;t at the forefront of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intangibles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through hell getting these things. My family can see my bank account and I don&amp;#39;t have a ton of money, so I didn&amp;#39;t want to order these on my card or else they&amp;#39;d be on my ass about it, but I did have a good amount of cash on hand, so I went and picked up a prepaid visa card from Rite Aid. It took like 5 hours to get the thing activated, I spent a ton of time on the phone on hold, hanging up, calling again, and researching ways to fix it myself because I feared I would never actually be helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I thought I would be moving into a new place the next day, so when I ordered I ordered from beach camera on April 30th, and their site said I could have them delivered by May 1st, so I dropped the extra $19 for 1 day shipping, and they ended up being about $207 all together. The website was wrong, they shipped the next day, and they only arrived yesterday on Monday, and their customer service refused to reimburse me for the 1 day shipping despite the site giving me the wrong info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, May 1st, the guy I was supposed to be moving in with ghosted me after I had taken apart all my furniture and packed my stuff up. I tried to get in contact with him about the package, but he ignored my texts, and if your packages arrive at another person&amp;#39;s house, that person owns them, so I spent 7 hours sitting in my car with shitty AC outside this guys house in the sun yesterday so I could intercept the FedEx driver and show them my ID before he got the buds and was allowed to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas cost for the car idling all day so I could run my AC + extra shipping cost was $34, and 7 hours of discomfort and boredom, plus the opportunity cost of not using that time for school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, and losing time I could have used to work on school work, I still feel like these were worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts, speculation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my right bud just died, after the left died 5 minutes before it. When the left died the right had 4%. That&amp;#39;s a total time of 3 hours 57 minutes. By the way, having plugged the left bug into the case at 7:52, it&amp;#39;s at 33% right now 8 minutes later. The right bud after 4 minutes of charging, is at 21%. I&amp;#39;m not sure about this, but given Google&amp;#39;s history of doing staged rollouts of features and A/B testing, it&amp;#39;s possible that they&amp;#39;re testing builds which prioritize connectivity over battery life and vice versa. Or maybe the battery life is only cut down cause of my phone settings, or how I was using the buds. Anything is a possibility with Google though. Just an aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy setup, awesome sound, comfortable, good call quality for me and the people on the other end, strong connection, decent battery(though when the algorithm takes forever to kick in it&amp;#39;s worrying), ultra fast charging, spectacular build and design, and the best purchase I&amp;#39;ve made in a long time in terms of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you still have any questions and I will answer them!&lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"Hi all,   


I've had my Pixel 3 for about 18 months at this stage &amp; never really encountered any issues with it. I keep it exclusively in a case and, with the lockdown, decided to take it out recently for a clean and because I was mostly using it just around the house. It was then I noticed that the back panel was splitting away from the frame, particularly in the middle, so I did some research online. Most things I could find suggested it was a battery issue and was pretty common on Pixel 3 devices; apparently it swells and thats what pushes the cover off. It can be quite dangerous (eventhough there was no issue with the phone itself) so I followed the advice of discharging it and then not charging it again.  


Either way, I decided to contact Google directly about it and went through the usual of sending photo evidence/providing info and they agreed to give me a replacement if I posted it to them. I got two options: i) Have a phone sent to me and a hold placed on my account until I sent my phone back or ii) Send my phone back and when they'd received it, they'd send a replacement out.   


I went with the second option, because I didn't want anything on my account, and they replied with a DHL booking form/label. I packed everything, but when I visited DHL to post it I was told they couldn't, as there was no account number on the booking. Put simply (after an hour of trying to contact Google) the booking wasn't attached to any account, so I'd have to pay directly for it to be sent or it'd just be sent back to the holding office. I left and contacted the Google team and they said they would investigate and get back to me - this was around 10 days ago. I contacted them again yesterday, about 8 days on, and was told they were still ""looking into it"".  


Could anyone offer me any advice or have they had similar experiences? I've been without a phone for most of two weeks now &amp; I don't get how they could issue a packing label without knowing their own account number with DHL? The staff at DHL were really helpful and I don't think it's an issue on their end, several people looked at it and came back to the same conclusion.

Put simply (after an hour of trying to contact Google) the booking wasn&amp;#39;t attached to any account, so I&amp;#39;d have to pay directly for it to be sent or it&amp;#39;d just be sent back to the holding office. I left and contacted the Google team and they said they would investigate and get back to me - this was around 10 days ago. I contacted them again yesterday, about 8 days on, and was told they were still &amp;quot;looking into it&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could anyone offer me any advice or have they had similar experiences? I&amp;#39;ve been without a phone for most of two weeks now &amp;amp; I don&amp;#39;t get how they could issue a packing label without knowing their own account number with DHL? The staff at DHL were really helpful and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s an issue on their end, several people looked at it and came back to the same conclusion.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I've also messed with the color correction thing but that didn't really do anything.

I just got some Pixel Buds and am really impressed with the look, build quality, and functionality. But I'm not sure I've found the right way to wear them.

Better hybrid zoom to 10x.(For better perspective and composition)

Real time video  and viewport bokeh effect.(For better composition on the spot)

Ultrawide that supports micro mode (something like one plus)

Ultra accurate bokeh cutouts (people dont realize it but bokeh is the second most important DSLR feature)

Customize bokeh more, customize bokeh bubbles, paint out inaccurate cutout on google photos, export depth map on third party apps like lightroom or photoshop or snapseed.(This will help a lot exclusive mobile photographers, or hobbyists)

Also i think its time for the addition of a full PRO mode ,a very important feature.

,GooglePixel,"Hey guys! Been trying out the Pixel buds since Saturday and wanted to share some first impressions.

&amp;#x200B;

Sound: Honestly they're extremely neutral and have been pleasing to the ear so far especially compared to my 2018 Gear Iconx's. They aren't the loudest but meet a good middle ground for what I would prefer anyways. Bass is in the background and 'there' but not loud or as present as I've experienced before. I'm not an audiophile but I haven't really found myself missing anything from the experience since the rest of sound seems well rounded and clear.

\*Hiss So I heard it a lot before the update to 225 and then it died down and is either not there or incredibly minimal\*

Fit/Comfort: It's subjective to your ear of course but I genuinely think Google knocked it out of the park. They're lightweight, fit immediately (the rubber isn't noticeable) and look great. I feel like this is a universal approach to try to meet as many people's ear shapes as possible and appreciate the design.

Battery: It looks like these hit right at the 5 hour mark Google was saying give or take 30 minutes for different use scenarios. Between the case and the buds I haven't been worried about running low and they both charge fast which helps.

Bluetooth: So here's where it gets a bit tricky. My first day was riddled with the right earbud constantly cutting out while i was walking around with the phone in my hand. Then I updated to version 225 the following day and it switched from the right earbud going out to the left. But it definitely didn't happen as often and as of today (5/5) I haven't noticed any issues whatsoever indoor or outside. I was going to rma but if it it sticks then I'll be fine. Fingers crossed.

Google Factor: As someone who uses the google assistant in my home and for day to day outings these are hands down the best investment i could've wanted. Having Google with me constantly and having it working EVERY time has been a pleasure. It just works which is great to say.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall: If the buds hold up connection wise (and I expected issues buying these the first week in, once i updated to 225 and noticed that the situation changed it proved it was only software related) then I'd consider this the upgrade i wanted for myself. Thats it y'all thats the tea.

,GooglePixel,"So I'm ""stranded"" in Colombia right now. Canadian. I got a friend a bit back just as lockdown started to buy a used but brand new pixel 4 128gb and ship it to me.

Phone - $720 (Cad)

Shipping - $109 (Dhl)

Customs.. $370 (Colombia)

Crazy. I literally got this in my hands the week after the country went in to full on lockdown, roads closed between cities. I paid the high government ransom tax of $370 with my credit card and as soon as I did boom, they drove it cross country 12 hours and delivered my phone. I swallowed the cost quickly, it was ridiculous but whatever though, given the state of things I was lucky to get my hands on this phone in this. 

Now for my unanswerable question:

I'm staying in a nice big place for this lockdown in arguably one of the country's best neighborhoods in a place with I have 50mbps internet. BUT all the essential apps that are of more importance than ever right now, load insanely slow. And it only happens inside this apartment with this provider.

Rappi - South America's uber eats/skip the dishes/food delivery co name - can take 2-3 minutes on average to get a quick orders in, or 5-10 just order a few waters or tequila or whatever.

Tinder- 3-5 minutes to load. Wayyy too long.

Google Translate - not working at all. Voice hasn't worked for awhile. Recently texted stopped completely. I'm using a .dict app now. Far less efficient but forces you to learn more I guess. No reason for this not to work.

Pimsleur antiquated language app, 4-5 minutes. Maybe that app itself just takes that long though.

It's crazy that a cutting edge Google phone is taking minutes and minutes to load basic apps. I went by a friends place a bit back and the apps loaded immediately, he had 100mbps internet though.

It's bad enough I'm considering moving, from a proven  safe and good place during this lockdown - just to hopefully get situated in a spot these fucking essential apps will load in reasonable times for my new daily house arrest life.

It's not like don't have the time, just don't want to deal with it. Do you guys think factory reseting the phone would fix the load times on these? If so I'm willing to do it.

,GooglePixel,"So my wife and I switched from Verizon to AT&amp;T awhile ago, and none of the new phones interested her so she just brought her Pixel 3 with her. I signed up for AT&amp;T's insurance since it was in good shape. Well sadly it got stolen a few days ago so it was time to file a claim. When I originally filed the claim online it said my replacement device would be a Samsung Galaxy S8. Oh no no no, that's not remotely comparable! I worked for AT&amp;T a long time ago and their insurance is supposed to give you a comparable phone or better. So I called their customer service mentally preparing to have to fight them tooth and nail this. I politely explain the situation and how that phone is almost 2 years older than my wife's pixel 3. I explain that we are big pixel fans and would really just rather have another Pixel 3. She explains that unfortunately AT&amp;T never sold the Pixel 3 officially so they can't give me that, however she offers to send me a Pixel 4XL instead.

I'm like hell yeah! At first i'm concerned because I thought i'd get hit with the maximum deductible, nope! Since my wife's phone falls in the BYOD category it's only $125 bucks. My next concern is that we'll get a crappy refurb, from my past employment I know it's like a 50/50 shot you get a new phone or a refurb( They can't promise you either way, you'll know what you got based on the box it comes in). To my pleasant surprise it was brand new in the factory sealed box!

I signed up for AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s insurance since it was in good shape. Well sadly it got stolen a few days ago so it was time to file a claim. When I originally filed the claim online it said my replacement device would be a Samsung Galaxy S8. Oh no no no, that&amp;#39;s not remotely comparable! I worked for AT&amp;amp;T a long time ago and their insurance is supposed to give you a comparable phone or better. So I called their customer service mentally preparing to have to fight them tooth and nail this. I politely explain the situation and how that phone is almost 2 years older than my wife&amp;#39;s pixel 3. I explain that we are big pixel fans and would really just rather have another Pixel 3.

I really really like Google and Android. For example, the Google Duplex is really cool. I actually ask my Google Assistant to call restaurant s for me (though it didn't succeed...). And I have been an iOS user for years. I guess I am getting bored about iOS even though it is really fluid. When I saw the price drop for P3 on Amazon (got it for $400).  ordered one. 

I really like it that I can do more with Android 10, like split screen for two apps(which I really like). But as someone who has been using iOS for years, I still struggle to understand why Google couldn't optimize the Pixel experience to be on par with iOS . I know I might get criticized by you guys. But I just want to start a discussion about how Google can improve their product.  

One small example about the difference is the text cursor. In iOS, the cursor can be moved by pressing hard on the space key on the screen to enable 3D touch/Haptic Touch. On Android 10, you can use glide typing gesture on the space bar to move the text cursor, however, only horizontally, which I don't understand. Why doesn't Google just walk the extra mile and just make it able to move anywhere?

After reading a lot of questions and feedback in here about various aspects of the [Pixel Buds 2](https://nickdenardis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/google-pixel-buds-2.jpg) I decided to write up what my first 48 hours have been like with them.

I have no comparison to other wireless earbuds but work at a computer all day on calls, record podcasts, and an avid runner.

This is my take as an average new user and address my experience with some of the things others have been mentioning, hissing, connection, mic quality, connection to a Macbook, etc.

\-----

## Appeal

Wireless headphones have never been my thing. I’ve had numerous wired headphones though, from the [Apple in-ear](https://www.apple.com/ie-business/shop/product/ME186ZM/B/apple-in-ear-headphones-with-remote-and-mic) to [Sony in-ear](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/dp/B00JRD13T8) to the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/us/product/usb_c_earbuds). For me, it’s all about how secure they are in my ear while on a long run.

The appeal of the Pixel Buds came from using assistant with the USB-C earbuds, it’s just so convenient. For context, I’ve never tried the original Pixel Buds or any other wireless headphones.

## Fit

Decided on the smallest pads. The medium size seemed fine, but after having them in for more than an hour at a time, I found the smallest ones were the best mix of fit and ability to hear talking when audio is paused.

They are seriously light though, it hardly feels like there is anything in your ears.

## Audio volume

At first, they felt pretty quiet, but after some adjusting, they seem only slightly on the quiet side. There is definitely something odd about the volume controls though. At times it felt like there were two volume controls while connected to a Mac. The output volume works like normal, but then there seems to be a separate Buds volume that is controlled through swiping. Sometimes they update in sequence, but with the Mac volume all the way up, I can still turn up the Buds by swiping until they top out. Not ideal, and probably a bug, but it may be why some people feel they are quieter than they should be.

## Swiping and touch controls

These feel completely natural and work really well. On two occasions though while running and trying to turn the volume up it thought I long-pressed and read me the time and all my notifications. This could have been due to sweat, but it was unexpected.

## Battery life

To be honest these (or any in-ear headphones) are not something I would want to wear all day long. I am on calls for 3-4 hours per workday, but I haven’t yet had the chance to see how long I would keep them in.

Spend the second day doing a ton of yard work and had them in \~40% of the day. Feels natural to put them back into their case when not in my ears and the longest amount of time wearing them only reduced the battery to 40%.

They come fully charged out of the box and after 48 hours the case is still at 38%. Even if I traveled a lot and wasn’t able to get to a charger each night, the amount of battery seems on par for what is reasonable and I likely wouldn’t spend more for a higher capacity battery.

## Adaptive sound

So far so good on this front. It is nice to hear conversations around me without have to take the Buds out. While running next to a loud road the sound did turn up automatically and then back down when it got quieter. While mowing the lawn it did the same. I would say the feature is pretty helpful but found myself still adjusting the volume between podcasts and wish the adaptive sound would equalize the output audio instead of assuming all audio is already equalized.

## Microphone

I’m used to recording audio on my computer with a podcasting mic. This one was a bit weird for me to wrap my head around. While connected to the Pixel 3 XL and making a call outside in a windy environment the person I was talking to said I sounded normal and they couldn’t hear any wind at all, which was great.

I make a lot of calls from my computer though, a 2017 Macbook Pro 13″ with Touch Bar. This is where things get complicated. I tried to record the mic and got some really horrible results similar to [Tech FireSide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcqkhyYvpa8). But realized it was only because Mac OS was doing some sort of downsampling only while recording, the actual call quality was really good.

After listening to someone else talk on them from the Mac or phone I can say the mic really is high quality and on-par with a wired microphone.

A real world test after a full work day will be telling though.

## Connection quality

Connected to the Pixel 3 XL the connection has been great, I was able to walk a good \~30 feet away inside and \~100 feet outside with no regression in the audio quality. Connected to the Mac though I was surprised the range was only about 15 feet at best. Apparently the 2017 Macbook Pro only has Bluetooth 4.2, which severely limits the range.

When moving from the Pixel to the Mac and back and forth multiple time the speed was fantastic. Only two or so seconds to disconnect and reconnect.

Some people have reported one or both Buds cutting out with head or body movement. I’ve run multiple miles with my phone in a [SPIbelt](https://spibelt.com/) and cut the lawn with my phone in the pocket with no cutting out from either earbud.

## Google Assistant

Something I’ve struggled with is going truly voice-based for all interactions. With the USB-C pixel earbuds, I was able to hear all notifications and they were read to me. I could prompt this by holding the mic button and it would read the time and then all unread messages.

Without the cord and with my hands dirty I’m looking for a way to do the same but with only my voice. I’ve tried the recommended “read my messages” with mixed results. I have checked my app notification settings and all the relevant ones are on.

I still haven’t found a consistent voice command to have Google read me all my unread notifications without touching the physical buds.

## Firmware update

It took a few times of taking the Buds in and out of their case and then leaving them alone for them to update then report their new version. There was no audible sound or notification to let me know they were being updated or that the update was complete.

## Hissing

I have not experienced hissing when connected to the Pixel 3XL, even when listening to audio at the lowest volume. As soon as they are paired with the Macbook Pro though there is a noticeable hiss when in-between apps/music but it seems to silence itself after a second or two. Definitely not noticeable or a dealbreaker and feels like it is coming from the computer instead of the Buds.

## Overall

The first two days have been wonderful. I don’t have a lot of context to other wireless headphones but compared to the wired ones I’m used to the Pixel Buds are great. I’ve found myself leaving them in my ears more than their wired counterparts.

I mostly listen to books and podcasts but the overall sound quality is great although if I really wanted to listen to rich music I would opt for over the ear headphones any day.

For me, the largest sell is the ability to access the Assistant and everything on my phone with voice.

,GooglePixel,"So I've seen a few posts already about leaks of the upcoming Pixel 4a and I devided I would collect some information here. A bit of a disclaimer up front; I cannot guarantee that any of this is acurate information but by the ammound of articles and leaks I have seen, this is what I would expect it to be. Also I am not a journalist or proffessional, just a 20 year old from Germany that is very exited for this device.  


[early renders of the Pixel 4a that are still holding up](https://preview.redd.it/74prw80o2tw41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9b458afb4346893bf7fc8b3fd50ebf62530e05)

The Pixel 4a will be the next budget oriented phone, suspected to be revealed around the 12th of May and shipped by the 22nd this month. This is based on when the Google I/O event was first supposed to take place and leaked shipping dates of the german phone carrier Vodaphone.  


Design wise it will feature a 5.81 inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 60Hz refresh rate, cutting the 90Hz from the Flagship Pixel 4. The 4a further features a hole-punch 8MP selfie camera and will not have the motion sense features included in the Flagship. Face Unlock will therefore also not be present.

On the back the 4a will have the same 12MP Camera that the past 3 Pixel's featured, housed in a similar Camera-bump to the Pixel 4, though it won't have a second camera. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor will also make a come-back for this phone.  


For the specs we're expecting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730, a still mid-ranged but still powerfull chip, that is supposed to rival the performance of the 2 year old Flagship Sd845.

From what I've seen people can't really decide whether this phone will come with 4 or 6GB of Ram and if it will feature 64 or 128GB of storage. My bet would be on 6 / 64GB though, at least for the lowest, $399 starter price. There could be a 128GB model available for a slightly higher price.

For additional feature's, we're sure to get a headphone jack again and no wireless charging or IP-certified water resistance. It will also only come with 4G and not 5G technology.  
The colors are suspected to come in ""Just Black"", ""Clearly White"" and the new ""Barely Blue"". I'm not sure how final the Blue color is but I could imagine it being a similar color to the mint colored pixel buds 2 that are still coming but we've already seen.

,GooglePixel,"Hey so ever since I updated to Android 10 I've noticed some stuff has been happening. I receive a lot of phone calls a day and the screening service is a life saver. 

But since Android 10 I've noticed that my received calls dropped from about 30 a day to 10 a month. Which is worrying.

,GooglePixel,"Hi All,

I've been dealing with connectivity issues with my Pixel Buds with my Pixel 3. They seem to work fine while I am in my apartment, but as soon as I left for a walk or run and put the phone in my pocket, it would cut out so much (left bud completely, right occasionally). I've always had issues with echos.

I was playing around in the Developer Mode settings on my Pixel 3 and saw where the 'Bluetooth AVRCP Version' was set to '*AVRCP 1.4 (Default*)' on my Pixel 3. I changed this to *AVRCP 1.6* and I noticed that this actually improved the Bluetooth connectivity on my Pixel Buds significantly (there are still cut-outs and echo, but significantly less).

Are the other Bluetooth settings in Developer Mode that might improve this? Anyone else want to try this and see how if it helps them?

UPDATE: Well, that fix seems to be short-lived. Yesterday they did pretty decent, but I just tried going on a walk and after about 5 minutes the left started continually stuttering/dropping out. And then it would come back in and be fraction behind, causing an echo effect. Sigh

,GooglePixel,"Apologies to the mods if this doesnt fit here but I'm seeing multiple people posting about issues they're seeing with their new buds, none speaking about my issue specifically.

Purchased the product a few days ago, finally came last night in shipping. I opened the box, tested the buds, no issues except the annoying buzzing that google support tells me is [completely normal](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/439520001657929739/706952461386121266/unknown.png). 

This morning I take them off the charger to begin listening and I notice the the right ear piece outputs no audio. It still responds via bluetooth, I can still operate media controls, in ear detection works, hell even the microphone still worked.

During a lengthy conversation with google support telling me to reconnect the device in different ways I accidentally drop the right ear piece. I pick it up and I can hear audio playing. 

My mind is racing as I begin to drop it over and over from about a foot onto my desk and note the audio randomly going in and out after each drop. Seems to be a loose cable internally and dropping it will reseat/disconnect the cable.

After some testing I let the support rep know and he escalates my case as its confirmed to be a hardware/design/production issue.

Now I'm still waiting on their tier 2 to get back to me but I promised a video demonstrating the issue and how I go about ""fixing"" the issue by beating it like Bob Ross's paint brush. I figured I'd share it with you too since it could be helpful and doesn't seem to cause any damage to the buds themselves (depending on your beating method)

,GooglePixel,"I don't understand the idea of including a type C to type A cable for Pixel Buds and Stadia controller at this point.

I let the buds drain; this resulted in the right bud draining to empty while a the left bud still had 10%.  I then put them in the charging case and tracked the charge status at 1 minute intervals for the first 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes until the buds reached around 80%, then every minute after that.

* **They get about 20% charge in the first 5 minutes!!**  Then about 40% within the first 10 minutes.  This really is in line with Google's claim of 2h of use with 10 minutes of charge.


* From 0% to 100% took 47 minutes


* They charge most-rapidly up until about 80%, then charge rate levels off reaching 100%


* The case lost 18% to charge both buds back up, it should provide 5 full charges to the buds

The buds charge seriously fast.  Compared to my Galaxy buds it's not even a competition.

What is also interesting to note from this data is the discrepancy of power use between the buds.  I posted a thread yesterday about drain after an hour of use, and there was a 20% difference between the buds after an hour.  I guess this evens out over longer usage.

At the same time, with one bud dying and the other still having 10% left, you don't get the full usage out of them, which is a bit frustrating as a consumer.  On the other hand, personally, I never really use headphones for more than maybe 2 hours straight, and the fast charge rate means I never really have to worry about them (I don't know how long it took to drain, I just set them to play when going to bed and came back to them in the morning; on retrospect I wish I had set them to play back with long video, then I'd know how long it took based on where the video paused at...).",t2_h0n50,False,,0,False,"I tracked the amount of time it took to charge the new pixel buds from ~empty to full, here is the result!",[],r/GooglePixel,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gcr3mk,False,dark,0.97,,public,664,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,664,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588543333.0,text,6,,,text,self.GooglePixel,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/moMvli0.png""&gt;Plots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have looked around, but none of the solutions online seem to be relevant or working. I would like to set the Facebook Messenger App to vibrate only. No sound, just vibration. Meanwhile I do not want to set my phone to silent, so just silencing everything is not an option. If I long press on the App, go into App Settings -&gt; Notifications, I either turn the app quiet, or turn on sound and then additionally turn on vibration. (I am really confused who could have ever thought this to be a good idea.)

My only idea right now is to just upload a silent audio file as custom ringtone, but it is kind of an ugly fix.

Help? :D

Edit2: Solution didn't work, the messenger just resets to defaul. So I just put a silent.mp3 in the Notifications folder, and set it as the tone. Lets hope it works.

Edit: SOLUTION:

Apparently if you go into the Android sound settings for the App you can select ""no sound"" as a ringtone which is hidden in ""My sounds"" (long press -&gt; Info -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Chats -&gt; Expand options -&gt; Sound -&gt; My sounds -&gt; silent/no sound)

,GooglePixel,"I'm surprised none of the other posts regarding the Buds have mentioned this, but I received my new Pixel Buds on Friday and immediately noticed some audio lag in certain apps.  The most notable was the Twitch app, audio was almost a full second behind the video.  Videos in the YouTube app have audio lag.  Streaming games through SteamLink app have lag.  Netflix appears to be fine, no lag that I have detected there.  Plex and Disney+ apps also have no lag.

I'll press the unlock button and it'll take like 10 seconds for it to do anything.

,GooglePixel,"Hi all,

I just bought a s10e on Samsung's website. I love the phone, but the battery is not ideal. I'm in the US using the snapdragon version and been getting 4 hours of SOT roughly, which is okay I suppose. I've now been using it on the medium power saving mode and yesterday got 5 and a half hours of SOT, which is much better. However, using the s10e on the medium power saving mode makes the phone less 'snappy' and it feels more like a mid-range phone in terms of its speed and processing power.

I'm still in the return window for the s10e, so I'm thinking about returning it and getting the Pixel 4a when it comes out (hopefully in the next few weeks?). I'm assuming the 4a will have a better battery, same size screen (5.8 inches), better camera, and will last longer in terms of updates (I like to own a phone for three years and Samsung told me I'll get Android 11 and 'maybe' Android 12 (but probably not).

Since I use the s10e on medium power saving mode (where the cpu is at 70%), I don't think I'll see a huge difference between the phones in terms of its speed, and I'll get all of the advantages of having the clean, stock android on the Pixel (the Samsung One UI is pretty much loaded with crap imo).

,GooglePixel,"Hello everyone

I just bought the Pixel 3a a several months ago and I have an annoying problem with the gallery.  
So I do a lot photo editing on my computer, upload it to Google Drive and download it on my phone. So far so good, but if I open up Google's Photo App, the photo doesn't show up immediately. Thus I downloaded an other photo album app and there the photo appears immediately.  
The problem is, a lot of apps like Whatsapp go through Google's Photo app if I want to share a picture, so it's pretty annoying to always open up the other photo album app first and share it from there, some apps don't even allow you to do so and it's such a pain to wait until the photo finally appears in Google's Photo app.

,GooglePixel,"So from the looks of things, looks like I am one of the unlucky few who have gotten a pair of malfunctioning Pixel Buds. They worked great that first night I paired them to my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. But the following morning I noticed that they don't automatically connect to my phone when I flip open the case lid. I have to manually go into my phone's Bluetooth settings and connect them there and even then, only the Left earbud is connected. Even the Pixel Buds app can't detect them. So I factory reset them once and went through the whole set up process again. A few minutes later from not using them, here we go again. We are having the same issues yet again. So I factory reset them again and go through the whole pairing process again.

They worked great that first night I paired them to my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. But the following morning I noticed that they don&amp;#39;t automatically connect to my phone when I flip open the case lid. I have to manually go into my phone&amp;#39;s Bluetooth settings and connect them there and even then, only the Left earbud is connected. Even the Pixel Buds app can&amp;#39;t detect them. So I factory reset them once and went through the whole set up process again. A few minutes later from not using them, here we go again. We are having the same issues yet again. So I factory reset them again and go through the whole pairing process again. I went through the whole troubleshooting process with Google this morning and now I can&amp;#39;t get them into Pairing Mode again.

I mean, you still had the odd commenter point out that the picture quality from the Pixel 3 to the Pixel 4 didn't really seem like that much of an upgrade, and losing the wide angle selfie lens was definitely an inconvenience, but largely the camera setup was still praised for being the new gold standard.

However, other than the camera set up, the rest of the phone was absolutely ridiculed to death, the poor battery performance was usually the headline, as it almost always is on Pixel launch day, and then of course you had the running commentary on how much of a gimmick the new touch-free gesture system was, the only real positive I can remember other than the camera on Pixel 4 launch day was the face unlock.

Fast forward half a year and it's now time for the budget Pixel 4a to be released, like last year, the Pixel 4a is largely expected to be a do-over for the Pixel 4, a chance for Google to iron out any major issues they had with the Pixel 4 and try and repackage it into a more financially friendly device, and like last year it's set to feature the exact same camera setup as the previous flagship release.

Over the last couple of days all I have heard is how brilliant the Pixel 4a camera is going to be, all of the leaked samples are doing the rounds around the internet, people are talking about how it's going to be a real competitor against the new budget iPhone, the tech community is truly a buzz with the new Pixel 4a camera setup....But, here's the thing, it's not a new setup, it's the exact same setup that took a back seat to the face unlock when the Pixel 4 was released.

What I'm getting out here is very simple, I feel like all of the best features that a new Google Pixel flagship has will always be undermined by the perceived negativity surrounding each new device, and by the time Google release their budget do-over mid year, all of those great features from the original flagship I now moved over to the budget device, and it's all people talk about, because there's no real downside to paying half of the price for almost the exact same features.

I myself don't particularly like budget phones, I will always prefer the Pixel flagships to their 'a' variants, so for me at least, it's just a little bit offensive that people are getting so excited for features and specifications that have existed on the previous Pixel for at least now half a year.

Where was all of this excitement and all of this talk when the Pixel 4 was released, price tag side, why couldn't we focus on how brilliant the camera setup was when it was actually debuted on the Pixel 4, why did we have to concentrate on all of the downsides of the Pixel 4.

For 5 years, the camera sensor hardware has almost been the same (nearly identical). This has been a bit disappointing for me.

It in fact reduced from \[1/2.3"", 1.55um\] to \[1/2.55"", 1.4um\] when moving from pixel 1 to pixel 2 (maybe for the DPPDAF Portrait mode enabling feature).

The pixel 5 may again come with the same sensor of IMX 363 which would be pretty disappointing OR they might upgrade it to **\[IMX555 1/1.7"" 1.8um\]** which would be a good upgrade but still feels sorta incremental.

What you guys think?

What are the areas the future pixel phone cameras can make serious improvements in? (Capturing super Fast action? Much better color science? HDR video? Improved slow motion? Super high ISO? 5x zoom periscope cams?...etc.)

Do you feel the next huge h/w upgrade and leap of the camera sensors and tech would come in the Pixel 5 or 6?

,GooglePixel,"Tl;Dr at the bottom

First off I'm sorry for another of these posts, but I hope it will be informative. 


The comfort level is immense. They are way less intrusive than the Galaxy buds and quite a bit lighter. They do not feel like much at all. The 'thorn' I find way more comfortable than the wingtips on the Galaxy buds, but I don't think the Galaxy buds wingtip was uncomfortable. 


Next up is features. The passive noise thing is basically on the perfect level, it is very helpful when you have music paused or are not playing something, but when music is playing it is not noticeable at all. **I do want to mention the hissing.** For me, the hissing or white noise only occurs for ~2 seconds tops after pausing music and after that is silence.

 I have not been able to test out Ambient mode yet, but I will update this post if I do. 


Next is touch controls. While not customizable, they are the best I've seen on an earbud. The answering and declining calls is easy and intuitive, having volume controls is phenomenal, access to Google assistant without wake word and notifications, and the normal gestures on top are standard and work well.


The notifications are great. They do not start speaking as they come in. Instead, when you are ready, you touch and hold any earbud until you hear a chime, then it will read you the time, tell you if you have Dnd on and then it will read you your notifications, pausing to let you reply hands free to messages. You can also touch and hold an earbud and start talking - while holding the bud- then release when you are done talking to use the Google assistant without the wake up word. 


Next up is the actual Google Assistant integration, namely how good is it? I have not used it much but there are a couple things I feel a need to mention. I was surprised, but you can send texts, call people, start music or podcasts and use Google assistant routines all on the buds. Another note: when using the wake words, it will answer on your buds first -everytime. That is honestly the best. The google assistant integration on the buds is great by my experience.

The sound quality is good, but I'm not great at audiophile reviews.

The case is incredibly smooth but solid, it doesn't feel fragile at all. The case magnets are also very strong both on the lid and the bud holders. 


As many others have said, the fast pairing is great and so is the in ear detection.

TL:DR The buds are extremely comfortable, sound great and include amazing Google assistant integration. The case is also very solid and feels great. The touch controls and notifications are also implemented very well. I think they were totally worth the wait.

EDIT: If people did not know already, you can translate by saying 'ok Google, help me speak [language]' and you do not need to have your phone open or on the translate app to translate other languages, you just can't reply without the translate app.

EDIT 2: Something I haven't seen people touch on yet is the chimes. The ones for when it's in your ear, when the volume goes up or down, if you skip a track answer a call. Take out an earbud, play or pause, etc. The chimes are really well made and they feel very Google. It's the small things like that that enhance the experience.

EDIT 3:
I also found out that you can mute the volume with your voice by saying ""Ok Google, mute"" It will continue playing what is on your phone, but the volume will be muted. You can unmute by turning up or down the volume on the buds with a swipe.

The feel of the case is premium and when you pop the lid, the look of the buds placed in the cradle to charging is also premium feeling and looking. The setup was seamless and easy. Within seconds everything was connected and working.

When I popped them in my ear, they have a very very comfortable fit. Way better than the Galaxy Buds which I still think fit very comfortably now this Pixel Buds take the #1 spot of comfort/fit. It feels like nothing is there. These things WILL NOT fall off when working out, biking, etc.

The one thing that annoys me is with these reviewers is them saying that there's no bass with these. I don't know what they're talking about but these have bass. It's not like Skullcandy bass/head rattling bass. It's present and you feel it but it's not obnoxious and doesn't ruin the vocals or instruments.

Then I tested out songs by CCR, Fleetwood Mac, Doobie Brothers, and similar bands and the sound quality is just great. It's what you get out of a pair of $180 earbuds.

My experience was much different and ran into issues that I decided it required its own post. 

Data: [https://imgur.com/a/1BH3cgL](https://imgur.com/a/1BH3cgL) 

Battery Usage:

I am using a Pixel 3XL for this test. I listened to two broadway soundtracks (Hamilton and 10 minutes of Greatest Showmen) for the whole 2.5 hours and made note of what the battery level was at each 5-minute increment. I had I am a business analyst by trade and this data was really cool to look at. It is clear that the buds do in fact switch master-slave as can be seen at around minute 70. I ran into some issues that could be affecting the battery life, and the master-slave switching (see below).

Battery Life Estimation:

I used two models for this I found the minute number where the battery average equaled 50% (top graph), which occurred at minute number 110. Extrapolating that out, I would estimate a 220-minute battery life estimation.

The other model used uses the full 2.5 of data and trends the data to zero, and we take the average of both of these points. So, in this case, we would be looking at around 165 minutes for the Left bud, and 270 minutes for the right bud. Adding these together and dividing by 2 (for having 2 buds) is 225 minutes.

Both of these models are estimating around 222.5 minutes, which is far below the stated 300 minutes.

Bluetooth issues:

I had not had any problems with these buds up until starting this test. I did just get them today, and used them for probably around five hours, though I probably never used them long enough to get them to switch the master-slave because I would always charge them when either bud was around 60%.

You can see the issues that I ran into at minute 105. I lost full Bluetooth connectivity, they did not show up in my Bluetooth list. So I plugged the right bud into the case and popped it back out. This seemed to work and I was connected again, but then the real issues started. 

Looking at the battery drain after the Bluetooth first dropped, it seems that the left bud was once again the master. About one time per minute the right bud would drop all audio and I would only have audio in the left bud, after about 5-10 seconds the left would then drop out as well, and then after about 10 more seconds, they both would come back up.

I believe the buds were trying to switch the master to the right bud but were unable to do so. After 20 minutes of the buds doing this, I once again had the Bluetooth fully drop, and they came back on their own. Looking at the data and the amount of battery percentage drop, it does look like the Right finally was the master.

Conclusion:

Ultimately this isn't something I can live with for a device that is $190. With Google's very short return window, I have opened a ticket with Google to return these buds. It is a shame too, I really like them, but with the really low battery life (less than stated in my experience, I would have been fine with 5 hours), and the Bluetooth drop, they need to be returned. Thanks for sticking with me this long.

&lt;p&gt;I used two models for this I found the minute number where the battery average equaled 50% (top graph), which occurred at minute number 110. Extrapolating that out, I would estimate a 220-minute battery life estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other model used uses the full 2.5 of data and trends the data to zero, and we take the average of both of these points. So, in this case, we would be looking at around 165 minutes for the Left bud, and 270 minutes for the right bud. Adding these together and dividing by 2 (for having 2 buds) is 225 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these models are estimating around 222.5 minutes, which is far below the stated 300 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not had any problems with these buds up until starting this test. I did just get them today, and used them for probably around five hours, though I probably never used them long enough to get them to switch the master-slave because I would always charge them when either bud was around 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the issues that I ran into at minute 105. I lost full Bluetooth connectivity, they did not show up in my Bluetooth list. So I plugged the right bud into the case and popped it back out. This seemed to work and I was connected again, but then the real issues started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the battery drain after the Bluetooth first dropped, it seems that the left bud was once again the master. About one time per minute the right bud would drop all audio and I would only have audio in the left bud, after about 5-10 seconds the left would then drop out as well, and then after about 10 more seconds, they both would come back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the buds were trying to switch the master to the right bud but were unable to do so. After 20 minutes of the buds doing this, I once again had the Bluetooth fully drop, and they came back on their own. Looking at the data and the amount of battery percentage drop, it does look like the Right finally was the master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this isn&amp;#39;t something I can live with for a device that is $190. With Google&amp;#39;s very short return window, I have opened a ticket with Google to return these buds. It is a shame too, I really like them, but with the really low battery life (less than stated in my experience, I would have been fine with 5 hours), and the Bluetooth drop, they need to be returned. Thanks for sticking with me this long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: 5-minute incremental data in link, 222.5 minute estimated battery life, Bluetooth connectivity issues, returning&lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"This happened on Thursday evening, but I haven't had time to post until now.

I received the Pixel Buds 2 on Thursday morning.  I was actually impressed with the Pixel Buds, 2.  The sound, quality, pairing, and overall fit them are impressive. I wore them all day as I worked, they were more comfortable than the Beast X w/ foam Comply tips I was using previously. 

Inspired by the Post made by u/jjricks I decided to test my Pixel Buds 2 while riding my bike. All in all the ride was about 20 miles, through downtown, then to some neighborhoods and finally to the trails.  

I like to hear the sound of cars while I ride, so I do not ride with my BeatsX . The seal BeatsX create block out too much noise. The Pixel Buds do a much better job of allowing road noise to enter the ear. I felt confident riding as I could still hear road noise. Additionally pausing by touching the earbud is more straightforward than searching for the volume rocker and clicking it. 

Enjoying my ride, I got through downtown impressed with the buds. Unfortunately I encountered some of California's finest potholes. After hitting one a large one, my left Pixel Bud was ejected and immediately ran over. I braked so hard my Garmin alerted my emergency contacts that I was in an accident. I recovered the left earbud, then removed my right and continued my ride.

I'm mostly doing this as a buyer-beware kind of deal breaker for some folks who invest in new tech, but maybe someone can come up with a fix to this. 

According to the [Homespot Bluetooth audio transmitter adapter product page](http://www.homespotdigital.com/homespot-bluetooth-5-0-audio-transmitter-adapter-with-built-in-digital-mic-for-in-game-voice-chat-usb-c-connector-aptx-low-latency-for-nintendo-switch-lite-for-airpods-ps4-bose-sony-and-bluetooth-headphones/), the headphones you want to connect with the adapter need to support ""Qualcomm’s APTX Low Latency codec"". I have just done some light research into the Pixel Buds 2 and found that they are *not* equipped with APTX. As stated on the product page of the bluetooth adapter, if your headphones are not equipped with APTX this leads to serious lag between what is happening on the screen and what you hear. This is what I experienced and prompted my research. Which is a real shame, I was looking forward to being stylish with my new gadgets. 

This issue could also occur in other bluetooth adapters, but Homespot's adapter is what I'm using. So far I've only tested in Handheld mode, but I can't imagine they'd work differently if the problem lies with the Buds themselves. 

Hope this helps someone who is experiencing the same thing.

The [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds) really blew my expectations out of the water. The bass, to me, sounds really good and it accurately captures the lows. If you're a basshead then pretty much no pair of wireless buds is going to satisfy you; they don't blow your ears out, but the bass is full and heavy.

If you're worried about bass, I would say that you shouldn't be.

Also, if anyone wants a comparison to the wired [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds), I would honestly say that for $30 compared to $180, the wired [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) are EXTREMELY worth it. The wireless [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds) definitely sound better, but the wired ones are nothing to sniff at either and still sound really good in comparison.

**EDIT**: I want to be clear, in my opinion the [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds) are good for being wireless earbuds **and** they are good when looked at in a vacuum. You might get better bass in some other buds, but the bass is still very good in the [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds).

The other point being made is that if you want value for your money and **don't need wireless buds** but still want something that sounds great, get the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) or [Apple earbuds](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug), both are $30 each, although I think the audio quality of the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) is much better than Apple's earbuds, but you won't really notice unless you own both.

,GooglePixel,"Hi all, 

I had a Pixel 3a last year and the phone was amazing -- the camera, battery, and performance all did a great job on a day to day basis. The only downside is when I would record band practices at a loud volume using the 3a (I tried several recording apps) and it was worst sounding audio I've ever heard (I compared the audio recording to my bandmates' iPhone XR and Pixel 3 recordings, and there's no comparison). The 3a's recording was clipping with tons of distortion -- it sounded like it was recorded on a moto g3 -- a cheap budget phone with a cheap mic and audio chip (I guess the 3a is a cheaper budget phone so there ya go). 

I'm thinking about the getting the 4a, but I'm worried it'll have the same issues, i.e. Google will make the performance and battery better than the 3a, but will still have cheap parts (mic) to keep the price down.

It's exactly as advertised--minimal, seemingly indesctructible and beautifully simple.  I put the lanyard on it, but since it will probably be either in my pocket or purse, I'll probably take it off.  I switch my (cheapo) phone cases like I'm changing clothes, and I know quality when I see it.  I have no doubt the case will last far longer than the buds.

Now for the Buds.  

I forgot about the 'buzz' that everyone is talking about which meant I also didn't hear it.  They have only been used during a dog walk and about 45 minutes in the house doing chores. There is always something going on around here so maybe it wasn't quiet enough, but since I'm almost never in a 100% silent situation, I'll either call myself lucky or such a non-audiophile that it just didn't bother me.

I can only speak to the battery life in that the buds didn't die during the use I gave it which was typical for me.  I do both ears while walking, and one while around/in the house.

I found out that I have weird ears.  One took the large tip, the other the small, but the buds were very comfortable.  I usually use Comply foam tips so I was pleasantly surprised.  I may write Comply to see if they will offer tips for these, but won't be bothered if they don't.  The sound for my audiobook was clear and crisp--I could hear the narrator take a breath hear and there--the sound quality was equal to my beloved Melomania 1 buds.

Okay, now the good stuff. Google Freaking Assistant is just fucking amazing.  I was looking for a tweak or two over what it does now, but man!  While on my walk I got a notification on my phone which I normally ignore.  The buds helpfully suggested that if I wanted to listen to it, to hit the bud til i heard a chime and let go.  It gave me another short instruction when it started that I was too jazzed to pay attention to, but it read me my entire freaking email, the text from my daughter AND the title of the LA Times article I was just sent.  So damn cool.

I am more than happy with just that feature since I get a lot of notifications on my phone that I miss since I don't like them cluttering up my watch and don't believe in grabbing my phone to look at each one.

,GooglePixel," I ordered Wednesday(29th) and it said it would be here by Saturday(May 2nd), but my order still shows ""preparing order"" so now I'm worried they don't have the stock they said they did and I missed out. Which would suck because when I ordered, I could have bought from google and had about a week delay but would have had some. Now they are sold out everywhere.

Pages: moderate user of that app and really enjoy it.

,GooglePixel,"I love my Pixel 3a but I've had the OIS (optical image stabilization) for the rear camera die on me twice in 1 year. I think I found an issue with Google Messages that could be causing the problem. Here's the steps to replicate the problem:

1) When messaging a contact, go into add photo mode. The camera will activate and OIS (when bad) will vibrate the phone.

2)Press the back button so you are now in regular text mode. OIS will turn off (since the camera is off).

3)Turn off the screen, then unlock the phone. You'll be back in messages, in text mode, BUT the OIS will be activated. So if the OIS isn't bad, you wouldn't notice. It would just feel as normal, but it's there and it's on, using up its life cycle.


So the ENTIRE time your texting that contact the OIS is being used even though you are only in text mode. If you text one main contact throughout the day (significant other, colleague, etc.) then this could add hours of use to the OIS daily. I doubt it's rated for that much use.

I think I found an issue with Google Messages that could be causing the problem. Here&amp;#39;s the steps to replicate the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) When messaging a contact, go into add photo mode. The camera will activate and OIS (when bad) will vibrate the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)Press the back button so you are now in regular text mode. OIS will turn off (since the camera is off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)Turn off the screen, then unlock the phone. You&amp;#39;ll be back in messages, in text mode, BUT the OIS will be activated. So if the OIS isn&amp;#39;t bad, you wouldn&amp;#39;t notice.

,GooglePixel,"So I just picked up the pixel buds 2 and have been highly anticipating them throughout the spring. I've never had ""nice"" Bluetooth earbuds, just a couple pairs of the cheap ones on Amazon. I do, however, heavily use and love my Sony ~~XM3s~~ WH1000XM3's for music, phone calls and PS4. I picked up the pixel buds looking for that seamless integration with my Pixel 4XL. So after my first work-from-home day, here are my impressions.

I got what I wanted, seamless integration with the pixel 4XL. Setup was quick and easy. The buds pair almost instantly when you open the case. You get a nice overview of battery level for each individual earbud and for the case itself in the settings menu.

Speaking of battery, I've found that the earbud battery life is about accurate to what Google says. At 5hrs of music playback and 3 hrs of talk time, it doesn't compete with other earbuds in the price range.

However, this hasn't been an issue for me so far because when I've been on phone calls today, I've just been using one earbud at a time. I absolutely love this feature and it seems to work very well. Want to use just one earbud? Take one out of the case and stick it in your ear. The phone recognizes which one you're using and which one is charging in the case. I took my first hour-long call this morning with the left earbud and drained it down to 66% battery, then swapped for the second consecutive hour call in matter of like 3 sec. I think I'll be doing this for most of my use cases, even when traveling, but if you're someone that needs both earbuds for long phone call sessions (over 3 hrs at a time) I wouldn't recommend these.

Sound is much different than my Sony's but I love it. You can easily hear the outside world, and there is crisp, clear music kind of just happening in your ears. It's much different than the ANC XM3s. You're kind of in your own isolated world with those headphones - it sounds that way and certainly feels that way as well. I imagine I'll be using the Sony's and pixel buds in different scenarios from now on. If I'm just listening to music at my desk, or on a plane, I'll be using the Sony's. If I'm exercising, taking calls, or working in the lab while on a call, I'll be using the pixels. In fact I think I'll be taking most of my calls with the pixel buds from now on.

Comfort: for my ears, these are very comfortable. They don't form a seal like other earbuds, but the little rubber spine fits perfectly- I don't think I could shake them out if I tried. I do have a cheap pair of ~~Aukey~~ Taotronics Airpod knock offs, and when I'm on a call with those, I purposely have to loosen them from my ear a bit, because it's hard to talk with a perfect seal on your ear. Anyways, the pixel buds are pretty comfortable for me for the first hour or two of wearing. After that, I felt like I wanted to take them out and let my ears breathe. 

However, my wife tried them and they absolutely do not work for her ears. The little rubber spine just does not have a place to rest for her ears. That being said, she knows she has weird ears and has a lot of trouble finding earbuds that work for her in general. She primarily uses the Bose 700's.

Later in the afternoon, I gave a test call to my wife from the car, and results were great. Used the Google assistant via the headphones to place the call, and that worked immediately, just like using it from my phone. At first I had just the right earbud in, and my wife said the audio was clear and she couldn't hear any of the background noise from inside the car. She couldn't tell I was actually calling from the car. I popped the other earbud in, and she said the audio got a bit louder, but still just as clear. Then I rolled down the windows expecting the mics to pick up the wind whipping around in the car, but nothing. Seems like whatever tricks Google came up with to cut out background noise really works, and call quality is great.

Overall, I'm loving the new pixel buds. I've seen some reviews mention that they're a bit overpriced, especially compared to the Samsung buds. I haven't tried those so I'm not in a position to compare value, but I will say that I don't feel like I paid too much. I'm very happy with the features, build quality and sound quality, enough so to write up a review on them.

TL;DR. Good sound, good comfort, great call quality, great build quality, great features, seamless integration with my Pixel, meh battery life. I'm a happy customer on the whole.

Hi everyone,

Okay so I dropped my Pixel 3a in the toilet (thankfully it was unused). I dried it off immediately and put it in rice to dry out for a few days (i know the rice probably wasnt a great idea). When i turned it on, the screen started acting strange like apps randomly opening and things were getting clicked on without me doing anything. After a few days though this stopped happening and just some parts of the screen were unresponsive. That was 6 months ago and i have been getting by using it with the unresponsive parts of the screen because i couldnt afford to repair it and i was overseas when this happened.

I was just wondering if it is at all repairable now or if i should look into getting a new phone. The phone is working fine now, the unresponsive areas are the only issue, but not sure if theres any hidden damage.

Would love to hear any advice! also i live in Australia if that changes anything",t2_380xdnd,False,,0,False,Water damage in Pixel 3a repairable?,[],r/GooglePixel,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gc1c34,False,dark,0.84,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588427327.0,text,6,,,text,self.GooglePixel,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"Hi. If anyone could offer any thoughts/suggestions I'll much appreciate it.

A few days ago, my 5 month old Pixel 4 lost all signal. No bars, no data. I rebooted it a couple times hoping to get it back online, but to no avail. So, I used it offline for about 20 minutes before it abruptly shut off. No logo or warning or anything. This was a first. I plugged it into the charger and tried holding down all the different button combinations, but nada. I'm wondering if it's bricked.

The battery was still half full when it shut off. Also, the phone was somewhat warm due to the hot Texas weather that day, but I wasn't putting it through anything demanding. To add to this, I have pretty much all of the non essential (polite way of saying 'pointless') settings/features turned off at all times, ie: motion sensors, assistant, smooth display, etc. I also keep it on airplane mode most of the time. I did have developer options turned on but only so I could force dark mode. Never messed around in there otherwise.

It's weird to me that the cellular service went out before it shut off. I haven't been able to come across any other instance of this. The phone is still being paid and doesn't have any external damage or viruses that I know of. Anyways, appreciated will be much help

,GooglePixel,"So first of all, I've never owned a pair of $100+ wireless earbuds in the past. I own a Pixel 3XL and have been holding out for these buds. Bought them right away when they dropped.

Got them in the mail yesterday and I absolutely love them. I've always had issues with earbuds in general. They all either hurt after 20 minutes, fall out, or both. That is until I tried the included wired earbuds that came with my Pixel phone. The sound quality was mediocre (To be expected) but I noticed the buds actually fit, stayed in, and didn't hurt.

Fast forward to yesterday. I pop the Pixel Buds in and love them immediately. The sound is great, the fit is super secure. (Which never happens for me). Even while walking today and I had it paused, after an hour or two with the buds in, I still had to physically reach for my ear to check if it was still in. They feel almost non-existent, and that to me, is astounding.

Now to the issue... And from my research, it seems this may just be the case with any Bluetooth wireless earbuds. Occasionally while I'd be walking, with my phone in my pocket or backpack, if I turn my head, or reach toward my face, one or both buds would stutter and temporarily lose Bluetooth connection (only for a split second at a time), but still, that seems a little disconcerting. Maybe I need a better place to keep my phone on my walks, or just try to avoid turning my head or reaching towards my face. If anyone has a suggestion, I'd really appreciate it. The only other Bluetooth device I had connected at the time was a Fitbit. 

That being said, I absolutely love everything else. During my 2 and a half hour walk, I listed to podcasts, music, and even had a phone call, wearing a face mask, while walking, and the recipient thought the call quality was good. Couldn't be happier with my purchase, just wish I could figure out how to avoid the Bluetooth stuttering.

TL;DR:

The Good: Buds fit perfectly in my ears that have issues with almost every other bud I've tried. Sound is great, easy to use, super secure in my ear, even over a long walk.

,GooglePixel,"Not sure if I just got an especially defective unit but my experience with these have been incredibly disappointing, verging on the edge of madness and anger. The problems I face so far:

1. Left ear cuts out way too frequently. I would have been willing to look past this if it happened once every 20 minutes or so, but so far it has been really inconsistent. If I'm holding my phone up and watching a video it's fine, but if I lay down in bed the left ear cuts out every 10 seconds. In a regular seated position, I get cut outs every half minute just by resting my phone on my lap. When using my friends $30 wireless earbuds from Amazon I get zero cutouts in literally any position I am in.

2. The buzzing is LOUD and AWFUL. I have more sensitive-than-normal ears (got tested by an audiologist one time for issues awhile back) and while I may not notice it that much while out and about, if I'm alone in my bedroom watching something or listening to music it's super loud to me, even more so when there's silent parts in the thing I'm listening to. A lot of audio devices I have used do have an extremely light, barely noticeable buzz to them, probably made audible by my sensitive hearing, but the pixel buds are probably the worst I have heard in a long time, and akin to dollar store earbuds.

3. Battery drain is strange. The right ear bud drains considerably faster than the left. Although I haven't timed it for the full reported five hours, I did run it from 100% to 0%. As my right ear drained to zero, my left ear was still at 50%. I heard this may be due to some sort of master/slave relationship but the discrepancy is way too massive to have any real benefit. I would've been fine with maybe a 10-15% difference in battery but a whole 50%? What's going on here?

4. The mic only works when it wants to. Haven't heard anyone talking about this, but I 'stress tested' the Google assistant asking all kinds of things. Half the time the buds either got it wrong or just didn't hear me say anything at all. I get far far better results just using my phone, and if my buds are always connected to my phone I see no use in using the buds for Google assistant anyway.

I'm going to RMA this unit I got but overall my interest in Google products has kinda soured with this latest generation of products. I've been a google fanboy ever since the Nexus S came out and have near consistently upgraded my phone with Google line products ever since. The Nexus line phones were damn near amazing and when Pixel series came out it blew me out of the water every time until the 4XL. Preordered it and had nothing but problems with it since (3-4hrs SOT even after clean reset, hiccups and slow down, wonky cell reception with the same sim that worked perfect on the pixel 2, the back plate for some reason is literally peeling off the back of my phone).

The fact these are problems I even have to face at this price point is an absolute disgrace. I thought I was paying for simplicity, high quality QC, and for it to 'just work', but so far it just hasn't been like that the past year.

I was super excited to get my pixel stand a couple of weeks ago but I haven't had the best experience so far.

I keep getting a notification on my phone asking me to verify my pixel stand. I press 'Next' and nothing happens.

,GooglePixel,"Okay friends.  My Google Assistant has stopped talking to me when I ask questions.

When I access the Assistant either by saying ""Okay Google, squeezing the sides, or tapping the App, the Assistant wakes up (colored bars moving), and displays the Assistant's response (such as, ""This is what I found."") and the answer/information to my question.  But, NO verbal Assistant.

Volumes are Up.  

If I go into Google &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Google Assistant &gt; Assistant &gt; Assistant Voice , the Assistant will talk audibly in all of the 10 or 12 different voices.

But, when I go back and access the Assistant, as I stated above, the Assistant will do what I ask, but it doesn't verbalize the responses.

I have checked everything I can think of for the past week, to no avail.  This is driving me nuts.

Thanks for any help/assistance.  (No pun intended.)

Went into Safe Mode, again.  I then tapped the Assistant icon on the Google Search bar.  The first two times, the Assistant did what I asked, but Did Not Verbalize.  The third (and fourth, fifth, and sixth) time, it finally responded Verbally.

Rebooted and tapped the icon.  Assistant did what I asked, but NO Verbal response.  This woman is killing me.  And, I cannot find an app that I uploaded recently that would have affected the Assistant Voice.

It gets weirder.  A bit later, I was doing a Search in Google manually.  (Tap the Search bar and get the screen with the keyboard and the search suggestions as you type.)  Slow me, I had forgotten about the microphone icon at the top of the page.  I tapped the icon, the Assistant beeped, I asked a question, and the Assistant displayed my answer on-screen and (wtf) answered VERBALLY. 

However, it didn't answer in the British Female voice that I have set, but in the default American Female voice, of course.

Tried accessing the Assistant, again, by the usual methods (icon on Home screen Search bar, squeezing the sides, or tapping the Assistant App icon).  And, of course, wouldn't you know, the Assistant displays answers on-screen, but NO Verbal response.

&lt;p&gt;But, when I go back and access the Assistant, as I stated above, the Assistant will do what I ask, but it doesn&amp;#39;t verbalize the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have checked everything I can think of for the past week, to no avail.  This is driving me nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

If you use Hands-Free AG (buds for both speaker and mic audio), the connection will drop and the audio will be crap. The audio quality is not unique to the buds though - it is due to the bandwidth of Bluetooth. However, I have never encountered the full connection drop with other devices before.

If you hover over the speaker icon in the Windows toolbar - it will display a bogus battery percentage (19% when buds were at over 90%) and possibly set the mode back to Hands-Free AG. At that point, my connection dropped again. So that is definitely not good.

,GooglePixel,"Welcome to the Battery Megathread, where you can find information and get assistance with any battery-related issues your Pixel might be facing. *All battery-related posts made outside this megathread will be removed.*

Before you make a comment, try these troubleshooting tips:

###Stay up to date with the latest version of Android and your apps.
Although some people may argue that a system update ruined their battery life (and occasionally this is the cause), it's always a good idea to make sure you device is running the latest version of Android (check anytime in Settings &gt; System &gt; Advanced &gt; System update &gt; Check for update). Security patches and major updates bring fixes not only for battery-draining bugs, but also protection against viruses and malware that may be stealing your charge, or worse. Individual app updates may also provide performance improvements to your battery.

###Check for power-hungry apps.
Despite battery-saving features like [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), some apps may still be able to drain away your charge undetected. Try the following steps to identify any power-hungry apps.

* Make sure that the ""Apps consuming battery"" notification is enabled, and wait a few minutes to see if it appears. (Find the toggle in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; notifications &gt; See all ___ apps &gt; More options (the triple dot) &gt; Show system &gt; Android system &gt; Notifications &gt; Other)
* Check the battery usage of your apps in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; More options (the triple dot) &gt; Battery usage. Remember that battery life may be reduced with usage of certain features (location, Bluetooth, etc.) and apps (gaming, video, etc.).
* Turn on battery optimizations for all apps, (Under Settings &gt; Apps &amp; notifications &gt; Advanced &gt; Special app access &gt; Battery optimization, and tap each app to change it to *Optimize*), and also enable Adaptive Battery, which limits rarely used apps (Under Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Adaptive Battery).
* Force stop or uninstall any new apps and monitor battery life. (You can do this by going into Settings &gt; search for *appName* &amp; select *appName*)
* Temporarily disable all installed apps with Safe Mode, to see if an existing/updated app is the problem. (Enter Safe Mode by pressing &amp; holding the power button, and then pressing and holding *Restart*, and finally tapping OK. To exit Safe Mode, restart your phone as normal. You may have to sign into some apps again.) If your battery life improves, use the aforementioned methods on older apps.

###Investigate battery intensive features.
Some functions on you phone may use more power than you expect, especially in different scenarios. Take a look at this list for **a few** possibilities:

* **Bluetooth** is notorious for its high-energy usage, especially when actively transferring data. Turn it off if it's not needed, and if you do, consider looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which need much less power.
* **Location** also uses quite a bit in order to pinpoint your position. Turn off Wifi/Cellular data/Bluetooth location accuracy (Settings &gt; Security and Location &gt; Location &gt; Advanced &gt; Battery saving &gt; Google Location Accuracy) or turn Location off completely.
* **Cellular** can also drain your battery when the signal is weak. At these times, more electricity is needed to stay connected, no matter if you're in the forest or underground. If you don't require a cellular connection (for example, if you have Wifi Calling), put your phone into Airplane mode and re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth if needed.

###Contact Google Support.
Google's dedicated Pixel support team may be able to help diagnose and fix your issue. Find them in Settings &gt; Tips &amp; Support, or just ask your Google Assistant ""troubleshoot my battery"".

###IF ALL ELSE FAILS, factory reset your phone.
Sometimes wiping your phone is all that's needed to bring your battery back to life. Google Drive and Google Photos do a decent job with keeping your apps and data (check in Settings &gt; Google &gt; Backup &gt; Back up now **and check** Google Photos &gt; sidebar (the three lines) &gt; Settings &gt; Backup and sync), but ***please personally make sure that everything is backed up to something off your phone.*** To wipe your phone, [follow the steps here.](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836)

I was a member of this community back when the first Pixel ever came out and then was the proud owner of a Pixel 2XL. 

Loved the phone. Hated the fact that I didn't have iMessage. Found the phone a tad big but still loved it.

Wife wanted to go back to an iPhone so we both migrated together to iPhone XR and got apple watches.

I bust out my Pixel 2XL the other day and it is such a good phone. Like really good. I had forgotten how good it was.

,GooglePixel,"Finished a 1.5 hour cycling loop and have a few thoughts on the Pixel Buds, this is coming from a strong advocate of headphone jacks:

(originally meant as a reply to u/thoriumdioxide but I figured others might want to see this)

(I also was using a Galaxy Watch Active 2 to keep track of the workout, so essentially had 3 bluetooth devices connected...? Or is the master/slave connection still a thing but it's cleverly worked-around?)

Pros:

* These are my first wireless audio device of any kind and I will say, getting rid of the wire is nice, especially for exercise.
* They have almost no weight to them compared to my usual over-ear headphones, it's easy to forget you're wearing them and they're incredibly comfortable.
* Google Assistant and touch controls is fantastic! I know everyone else bought headphones that can do this years ago, but being able to shuffle an album, turn up the volume, play/pause, or text somebody without stopping to look at my phone is life changing. It can also pick up my ""Hey Google!"" easily, even when the wind is rushing past.
* I can wear a helmet again instead of my headphones (safety bonus!)
* They sound great! Not an audiophile, but I think these are incredible for such a tiny package!

Cons:

* On my hour-and-a-half-ish cycling trip there were unfortunately a lot of little hiccups. I'm not sure how much of it was caused by external interference or complete incompetence on my part, (likely the latter) but I'll break it down:
   * Although you can listen on either bud, I still feel like there's possibly a master/slave connection going on here, with the right and left buds respectively. If I cup a hand over the right bud, the left one stops working. If I cup a hand over the left bud, the left bud... also stops working. Maybe I'm misinterpreting this, can't be sure. It starts up again immediately when the hand is removed. I first noticed this when going to pause the music and the signal dropped out. (Still have this problem even when only my finger is touching it. Could this have to do with wearing a helmet? Not as easily reproducible just sitting here at my desk. I thought they advertised I could walk x number of feet away from my phone and they would still work. If they're cutting out at 2 to 3 feet I don't know what to think)
   * Quite a few times during the trip the connection seemed to cut out briefly, just randomly; always the left bud, and always slightly jarring.
   * I might've been imagining it, but I think for a few minutes during the latter-half of the workout, the left bud slightly was louder than the right one, throwing me off balance a bit. It's all cleared up now, however.
   * Interestingly enough at one point they completely quit working altogether, but I'm not convinced it was entirely their fault. I was about 7 miles north of home and both buds suddenly cut out, making the disconnection chime. I struggled to connect them for about 10 minutes (clear pairing, rebooting phone, etc.) then eventually gave up and resorted to cycling home in silence. However relocating by 100 yards seemed to do the trick, and they continued functioning afterwards. First guess is that I wandered into some sort of unknown 2.4GHz bluetooth-jamming-mega-dead-zone, but my Galaxy Watch was connected just fine the whole time, so I can't say. Maybe I'll go back to that spot and see if they disconnect again.
* The Assistant can't tell me what the battery level of the buds is, instead vocally redirecting me to the app. A minor thing though, for sure, but annoying while on a bike
* Not sure how much they can do about this since hardware limitations are a thing (and the fact that something this small sounds this good, and even exists in the first place is a a miracle of engineering in my outsider's opinion), but a slight buzzing is definitely noticeable in the background of quieter audio. Full disclosure I'm a hobbyist-pianist 'blursed' with perfect pitch, and known by family members to have extremely sensitive hearing (but terrible red green color-blindness, if that makes up for anything) Doesn't bother me much, but it's there
* After wearing over-ear headphones for so long I forgot that wind-noise is something you hear while cycling, but there's nothing actionable about that so...  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Overall though, it's been a positive experience and I don't regret getting them. I'm sure the software experience and stability will improve over time; maybe that's why they waited so long to launch. When all is said and done I'm still glad that the headphone jack is an option for at-home listening on my Pixel 3a, and I still resent... ""a certain company"" for making dropping the headphone jack into an industry trend, especially when bluetooth has demonstrated to me tonight that it's not ready for prime-time.

Would recommend!

TL;DR They're pretty great, a bit glitchy at times, but definitely worth it in my opinion

,GooglePixel,"hey. i have a Pixel 4 and i love it despite some flaws, but there is one thing that bugs me most about it. the fact that Google doesn't force their app developers to follow new Android rules (for a lack of a better term) such as the notification gesture bar. 

**here's some examples:**

[example 1](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4yn7UXfYb1vopbfm6)

if you don't understand, some apps do stretch out all the way to the bottom of the screen, but many apps do not. this leaves an ugly black bar where the gesture bar would be. there is nothing more annoying than having a phone with a nearly full screen display have and ugly black intrusion *(not to mention that the 4's very curved corners make it much worse than on a Pixel 2 or so)*

**more annoyingly, some apps can't decide if they stretch to the bottom or not:**

[example 2](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wUr2i8FJTcNjkBBi8)

this probably even more an annoyance because it shows that 1. app developers don't really care whether their apps work properly or not and 2. Google hasn't built even a minor (but a welcome aesthetic change) to their OS.

i know this sound like the most first world of issues, but Apple forced their developers to do this with the X series of devices, but Google with a lot more clout and power, doesn't care if app devs work with their OS or not.

,GooglePixel,"Good Morning 

This morning I attempted to unlock my Google Pixel 4XL, but something strange was going on. The ""Talk Back"" feature was going off, constantly reading what was on the home screen after each time I touched the phone. I could not get my phone to swipe up. It just keeps reading. So I double tap on a notification and it gives me my pin code option. I have to tap a number 4 times just get it to recognize the number. Once I get into my phone ""Talk Back"" starts reading EVERYTHING. I can't swipe any direction or open any apps. Not even the one I clicked on the notification for. Weird. So I restart the phone hoping that maybe it's just bugging out. This turns out to be a terrible idea because now my phone is set to Do Not Disturb. So I no longer have the only way I was able to get into my phone. I can't use the google assistant either. My phone is completely unresponsive except for the ""Talk Back"" feature.

What do I do? I've tried literally everything I can think of and nothing is working. Has anything like this happened to anyone? Fourms about Pixel issues are sparse so my only option is hoping that the Verizon store is opened today. I just had to break my plan to get this phone after my Pixle 2's digitizer went out.

,GooglePixel,"Just picked up the Pixel 4XL and holy cow this phone is so underrated. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 Plus and this thing is really impressing me. I'm so glad that I took all the reviews with a big grain of salt. There are so many things I disagree with on all the reviews.

1. Display/Forehead: This display is freaking amazing I was expecting the ""forehead"" to be way bigger. It doesn't bother me in the slightest and I'd take it over a ""notch"" any day.

2. Radar/Motion: If you don't like it to skip songs,don't use it! It's worth it for the amazingly quick face unlock alone!

3. Battery: I have no real issue at all here.

is pixel 4a gonna be better in these ways:

from most important to least

**price:** &lt;$280

1. **comparable or better display than galaxy a51**: what are the main sites that tests the display quality of phones (brightness, color, everything else about displays, etc.)? so we can compare. has to, at the bare minimal, have similar resolution + screen size, or better
2. **better or comparable gps antenna than galaxy a51:** how does the gps antenna compare to other ones? any tests / analysis? what company made the gps antenna?
3. **phone options:** what newer or old phones have comparable resolution and dispaly size? and costs less than $280, and is better?
4. **good sites to find better phones:** what site could we look at once a year or once every 6 months to see that those new phones are better?
5. **cpu where you dont notice anything slow:** is performance noticeably slow under minimal settings for regular stuff on a weekly basis like using google maps? (say you turn off phone animations and other nonsense)
6. **consistent reliable os updates (guess iphone se + pixel is best at this part):** does having os update matter? if so why exactly?
7. **energy:** battery doesnt matter yea? cos that's what powerbanks are for?
8. **ui:** has anyone used all of the main android modified uis recently (within last 3-6 months) and able to compare them?
9. anything else helpful or insightful to know?

please recommend phones better than other phones in these ways

So I got my new PIxel 4 XL the other day and noticed that it has a green tint when the brightness is below 50% with a gray background when in a dark room. During the day it's not noticeable.

I looked it up and some people have said that it went away after certain updates and it sounds like it&amp;#39;s a software issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is offering to replace my device, but I want to know if anyone had this problem before and if it&amp;#39;s worth the hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,GooglePixel,"Sorry for the length of this post. I ordered the pixel buds on release day and unfortunately was one of those with bluetooth connection issues while on the go (out for a walk or run or with phone in pocket or arm sleeve). I was the first to post about changing the bluetooth avrcp from 1.4 to 1.6, which improved the connection somewhat but not enough. Google sent me a replacement pair which suffers from the same issues. I’m wondering if perhaps this is an issue with the Pixel Buds and Pixel 3 phones (I feel like several others who have posted with issues also have the Pixel 3).

**Issues:**

If I am at home with my phone resting on a table, the connection is fine (with the occasional quick cutout). I am able to walk somewhat freely around my apartment.

As soon as I go to leave, there is extremely bluetooth stuttering, generally with one bud staying connected and the other cutting in and out. This was extreme when the phone is in my pocket, but still would happen with the phone in my hand or in an arm holder. With the first pair of pixel buds, it was the left bud that generally cut in and out, but with the 2nd replacement pair, it alternates. Also on the first pair, the left bud would occasionally be a fraction of a second behind, causing an echo. I haven't seen this yet on my 2nd pair.

I noticed that after 1-2 minutes of this, the connection generally would stabilize. However after 20-25 min, the connection would start to stutter again, and at this point one of the buds will just completely disconnect (the button not work or anything). This happened to me on both the first pair and 2nd pair of Pixel buds. Both times I took the buds out of my ears, put them back in the case, and then retried them. Neither time did this help. Not sure if my sweat caused this, but when I tried the buds an hour or so later, they worked fine.

**Steps Attempted**

Google CSR Sent the following steps. I attempted them multiple times on both sets.

* Make sure the Pixel Buds firmware version and Play Services are both up to date
* Uninstall and update the Google App from Play Store
* Restart the phone
* Reset the Pixel Buds then proceed to pairing and test

In addition, I did a factory reset on my Pixel 3 to see if that would help (and y’all know how annoying that is to do). I did not. Changing the bluetooth avrcp to 1.6 helped somewhat but not really. I don’t really know what the other settings in developer mode does.

Google sent me a replacement pair, hoping that it would fix it. They have not worked.

Maybe it’s an issue with my particular phone? My friend has a Pixel 3 phone. We connect the buds to his phone to see if he had issues, and he had the same connection issues as I have, which leads me to believe that it’s not just my phone and it’s a general issue with the Pixel 3. 

I replicated the same walking/running/biking conditions with other bluetooth headsets I have and none of them had any issues with bluetooth stuttering, connection dropping, or echo. These include:  


* WH-1000XM3 (best headphones ever)
* Anker Soundbuds Curve Wireless Headphones
* Xiaomi Redmi Airdots ($20)
* Uproar Wireless Bluetooth Headphones

Overall I have been really disappointed with the Pixel Buds. Honestly, they don’t seem to work better than the $20 Redmi Airdots.

I recently bought a Google Pixel 3a and I honestly love the phone. The one thing that is bothering me though... I am constantly losing connection when it comes to phone calls, and will have a call drop at least once during a conversation.

In addition, whenever a call is dropped, I have to either restart my phone or wait a bit before calling back because the call won't go through (I assume until connection is restablished). 

I am by no means tech savvy, but I have had the SIM card switched, taken to T-Mobile to have it looked at, and was told to keep Mobile Data on at all times to ""resolve the issue"", but nothing seems to be working. :/

,GooglePixel,"I have a Pixel 2, now running the May 2020 security update. A few weeks ago, I started having issues with the pattern unlock- it suddenly stopped accepting the pattern I know to be correct. It doesn't ""lock out"", as in, I can try repeatedly, seemingly infinitely. But even after entering the same (correct) pattern 50 times it may still not unlock. Fingerprint sensor works, but sometimes it says the pattern is required for extra security, and of course the same goes for after a reboot. 

About 2 weeks ago I was totally locked out. I ultimately had no choice but to factory reset via recovery mode. Interestingly, upon restoring my apps/data from my Google backup, it asked for my pattern to confirm it's actually me- and that worked fine! So it's not as though the pattern stored suddenly changed, it's just that Android is temporarily not recognizing the pattern as being correct. 

After the reset, things seemed okay...for about 2 weeks. Now the problem is back. The only solution seems to be rebooting and hoping that after swiping the pattern a few times it lets me in. 

Note that this is EVEN WITH smart lock set to keep my device unlocked at home. 

I contacted Fi support and since my phone is 1 month out of the 2 year warranty, their only solution is to contact ubreakifix, which I can't imagine would be helpful in the case of a software issue like this.

I'm using Android 10, and everything else working well. I use CPL (Customized Pixel Launcher) and the Pixel Icon Pack. Not sure if that's relevant. My issue is triggered upon restarting the phone. My desired behavior is the screenshot timed ""3:26"" with just a black screen (no time/app dock). After restarting the phone and tapping the square, I see a screen like the screenshots timed ""5:40"" or ""8:28"" (with the app dock, sometimes with the time/weather as well).

,GooglePixel,"Howdy all,

I used to have PiP working on YouTube a long time ago, when it randomly stopped (I've never had a yt red subscription, which I hear would have been the issue for some). I thought nothing of it because I didn't use it a lot, I just assumed YouTube got rid of the feature.

However, I was watching a YouTube video in chrome, and that one actually went to PiP when I pressed home. 

So, is there a way to get this back on the official app? I have the setting enabled in the phones settings, but I can't find the setting in the YouTube app.  I've tried changing the alignment/rotation and various tricks involving having the video paused or playing on the minimised bar inside the app. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the app, and I can't see the option for PiP in the general settings inside the app for any of my 5 accounts.

For what it's worth I'm from the UK, as I understand location used to be an issue (but I doubt that's the problem, as it's worked before and works when on the mobile version of the website in the phone browser).

I like to listen to long form content that's only on YouTube whilst I work out, and it's very disruptive to have to stop when I want to set a rest timer, so any help would be much appreciated.

,GooglePixel,"Hello all.

Have a Pixel 2 XL that I took to Ubreakifix to have LCD screen bleed and non-functional vibration motor replaced, per the promotion details at:

 [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/24/2021652/0/en/uBreakiFix-and-Google-Offer-Free-Pixel-Smartphone-Repairs-to-Those-Helping-and-Healing-on-the-Frontlines-of-the-COVID-Crisis-in-the-United-States.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/24/2021652/0/en/uBreakiFix-and-Google-Offer-Free-Pixel-Smartphone-Repairs-to-Those-Helping-and-Healing-on-the-Frontlines-of-the-COVID-Crisis-in-the-United-States.html) 

Called the local Ubreakifix a few days ago and they stated I qualified and just needed to present my badge. I went in, presented said badge, and they said they would repair everything. Later on that night, they send me a text and state that because the phone had been ""tampered with"" during an alleged previous repair, they cannot honor the letter of their promotion which bars warrantied repairs for ""previous tampering."" I bought phone used so I don't know if it had been repaired previously or not. I read the press release by Ubreakifix again myself and then sent them a copy and also read to them that it states "" An emergency responder or healthcare professional with a Google Pixel smartphone can present his or her ID badge at any of uBreakiFix’s more than 500 participating U.S. locations to receive one free repair, regardless of the device model or type of damage. Common repairs include screen damage, charging port issues, battery replacements, camera issues, speaker issues, and even liquid damage in some cases."" I also chatted with a support staff from Ubreakifix to get a second opinion, and he stated that regardless of the condition of my pixel, whether it had been repaired previously or not, it should qualify because this was essentially an out of warranty repair and the promotional details were worded very liberally. He didn't know why the local store was taking that particular angle and advised me to reach to google, because google would be ubreakifix's guide in terms of repairs.

I chatted with Google support and explained to them the issue and the initial support person was quite supportive, stating that they would set up something with an Case ID that I could then forward to ubreakifix and ""you will be taken care of"" per the promotion details.

I sent the  Case ID  via email to  the uBreakiFix store. They then claim to have contacted Google and then came back and said that if I agree to pay about $300 to have the screen replaced, then they can proceed with evaluating and fixing whatever else is wrong with the phone. I pointed out that this again does not honor the wording of their company's promotion, as detailed specifically in their widely circulated press release. I requested that UbreakIfix conference call me in on with google support on the phone so I could hear for myself and they refused.

I once again reached out to google and advised them of what their partner in this promotion, uBreakiFix, had been doing, and they advised me that the issue had been ""escalated"" to a specialist/supervisor. It's been 3 days since this started. 

I have a collection of google products: Pixel 3, Nexuses (Nexi?), and several tablets.

My experience with Google in the past is that when they say ""escalation,"" it basically goes nowhere.

Your advice please. I came across a ""DMziggy"" while searching for ways to address this issue, but it seems that since then they have closed his support thread.

&lt;p&gt;Called the local Ubreakifix a few days ago and they stated I qualified and just needed to present my badge. I went in, presented said badge, and they said they would repair everything. Later on that night, they send me a text and state that because the phone had been &amp;quot;tampered with&amp;quot; during an alleged previous repair, they cannot honor the letter of their promotion which bars warrantied repairs for &amp;quot;previous tampering.&amp;quot; I bought phone used so I don&amp;#39;t know if it had been repaired previously or not. I read the press release by Ubreakifix again myself and then sent them a copy and also read to them that it states &amp;quot; An emergency responder or healthcare professional with a Google Pixel smartphone can present his or her ID badge at any of uBreakiFix’s more than 500 participating U.S. locations to receive one free repair, regardless of the device model or type of damage. Common repairs include screen damage, charging port issues, battery replacements, camera issues, speaker issues, and even liquid damage in some cases.&amp;quot; I also chatted with a support staff from Ubreakifix to get a second opinion, and he stated that regardless of the condition of my pixel, whether it had been repaired previously or not, it should qualify because this was essentially an out of warranty repair and the promotional details were worded very liberally. He didn&amp;#39;t know why the local store was taking that particular angle and advised me to reach to google, because google would be ubreakifix&amp;#39;s guide in terms of repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
